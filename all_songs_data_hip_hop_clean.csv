as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables  skillaholic  kill  them all with  this flippity dippityhippity hiphop you do not really want to get into a pissing match with this rappity brat  packing a mac in the back of the ac backpack rap crap  yapyap  yacketyyack and at the exact same time  i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicing that i will still be able to break a motherfucking table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic  i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are having a rough time period  heres a maxi pad it is actually disastrously bad for the wack while im masterfully constructing this masterpiece as  because im beginning to feel like a rap god  rap god all my people from the front to the back nod  back nod now  who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box let me show you maintaining this shit are not that hard  that hard  everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like  have got well  to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance

students me im a product of rakim lakim shabazz  2pac  nwa  cube  hey doc  ren yella  eazy  thank you  they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position to meet rundmc  induct them into the motherfucking rock and roll hall of fame even though i will walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i will be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think it is all a game  til i walk a flock of flames off a plank and  tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin little gaylooking boy so gay i can barely say it with a straight face  looking boy you are witnessing a massacre like you are watching a church gathering take place  looking boy oy vey  that boys gaythat is all they say  looking boy you get a thumbs up  pat on the

get outta my face  looking boy basically  boy  you are never going to be capable of keeping up with the same pace  looking boy  because  im beginning to feel like a rap god  rap god all my people from the front to the back nod  back nod the way im racing around the track  call me nascar  nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park  the white trash god kneel before general zod this planets kryptonno  asgard  asgard  so you will be thor and i will be odin you rodent  im omnipotent let off  then im reloading immediately with these bombs  im toting and i should not be woken im the walking dead  but im just a talking head  a zombie floating but i got your mom deepthroating im out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common  poodle im a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil it is me  my honestys brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i want to make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i got to keep a few punchlines just in case  because even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put  them all in a line  add an ak47  a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i are not as big as i was  but im morphing into an immortal  coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya  like when fabolous made ray j mad because fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad singing to a man while he played piano man  oh man  that was the 24 7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day  hey fab  ima kill you lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  jj fad  uh  summalumma  doomalumma  you assuming im a human what i got to do to get it through to you im superhuman innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and im devastating  more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading  and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off  they will be celebrating because i know the way to get  them motivated i make elevating music  you make elevator music oh  he is too mainstream well  that is what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it it is not hiphop  it is pop because i found a hella way to fuse it with rock  shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make  them lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while im ripping any one of these s that versus you it is curtains  im inadvertently hurting you how many s i got to murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh  school flunky  pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself  but still hungry i bully myself because i make me do what i put my mind to and im a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues  but it is still tongueincheek  fuck you im drunk  so  satan  take the fucking wheel ima sleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz  still chunky but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils  and heres what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have  then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it  lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i cannot batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan  it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas and take a vacation to trip a broad  and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,2013.0,1586

im just a talking head  a zombie floating but i got your mom deepthroating im out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common  poodle im a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil it is me  my honestys brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i want to make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i got to keep a few punchlines just in case  because even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put  them all in a line  add an ak47  a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i are not as big as i was  but im morphing into an immortal  coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya  like when fabolous made ray j mad because fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad singing to a man while he played piano man  oh man  that was the 24 7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day  hey fab  ima kill you lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  jj fad  uh  summalumma  doomalumma  you assuming im a human what i got to do to get it through to you im superhuman innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and im devastating  more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading  and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off  they will be celebrating because i know the way to get  them motivated i make elevating music  you make elevator music oh  he is too mainstream well  that is what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it it is not hiphop  it is pop because i found a hella way to fuse it with rock  shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make  them lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while im ripping any one of these s that versus you it is curtains  im inadvertently hurting you how many s i got to murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh  school flunky  pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself  but still hungry i bully myself because i make me do what i put my mind to and im a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues  but it is still tongueincheek  fuck you im drunk  so  satan  take the fucking wheel ima sleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz  still chunky but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils  and heres what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have  then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it  lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i cannot batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan  it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas and take a vacation to trip a broad  and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,2014.0,1586

1188,Eminem Featuring Sia,Guts Over Fear, feels like a close  it is coming to fuck am i going to do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i  thing i know  sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same  old song ever since i came along from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinking my name was fault because anytime things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg gangsta naw  courageous balls had to change my style  they said im way too soft and i sound like az and nas  out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that ive been against it it was ingrained in me that i would not amount to a shitstain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just want to play my part  should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i do not want to seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon but sometimes you got to take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep pluggin  it is your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they going to talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah feel like ive already said this a kabillion eighty times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really want to say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to  afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out  out  out afraid i never before i did not want to go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear  the time is here guts over fear  i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down guts over fear  guts over fear  feels like a close  it is coming to fuck am i going to do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i  thing i know  it is like i was there once  single parents hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it was not until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on that i made a spark  started to spit hard as shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain ive caused but what am i going to do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in the trailer park and the window that was closing and there is nowhere else i can go with flows in and im frozen because there is no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i made for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same  old song but i would rather make not afraid 2 than making another mothafuckin we made you uh now i do not want to seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise  pray to god i just opened enough eyes later on gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong and enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt because i cannot explain to you all how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my damn self but on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you  ma  because that gave me the strength to because shadymania  so many empty that stadium at least i made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted i represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that i made this song everything you are scared to say do not be afraid to say no more from this day on forward  just let them aholes talk take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when im gone and to think i was gone  afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out  out  out afraid i never before i did not want to go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear  the time is here guts over fear  i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down guts over fear  guts over fear,2014.0,983

1335,Machine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello,Bad Things,cabello kicked off her solo career and her band sisters in fifth harmony unexpectedly denounced her for it now she is got a top five single  a muchanticipated album coming and zero second thoughts you have to honor that inner voice  camila cabello is late for brunch but not sullen  rockstar  hidingbehindshades late more like 19yearold  mixeduptheaddress late she is running through the dining room of versailles  a cuban restaurant deep in los angeles san fernando valley  lush black hair streaming  apologies pouring forth  having just rushed from the other versailles  in the citys center  as soon as she sits on this midjanuary sunday morning  flashing that disarmingly broad smile  the singer  who was born in cuba  resides in miami and is staying in an airbnb here in town  says  ive got you on what we are going to eat she then proceeds to order  in rapidfire spanish  a bounty of food lemonades  steaks  rice  beans  plantains  croquettes  flan  confusion  stress  the promise of a splendid feast that has pretty much been the story of cabellos recent life it was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of fifth harmony  the most successful girl group since destinys child  with more than 7 million digital songs sold  according to nielsen music  before the year was out  she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates  namely  that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions  and even hatetweets from zealous fans  see #camilaisoverparty  but that is the confusion and stress during that same time  cabello had plenty to celebrate the singer  who had collaborated outside of 5h for some time  released the darkly sexy rapromp single bad things with machine gun kelly last october  and it climbed the charts  it is now no 1 on the mainstream top 40 chart  and that is not even her first hit i know what you did last summer  her 2015 duet with shawn mendes  peaked at no 20 on the billboard hot 100  she has social numbers to rival the bands  34 million to 5hs 38 million on twitter and 88 million to 82 million on instagram  a guest turn on a major lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems  in retrospect  like an inevitable transition to solo stardom  it would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world  says her friend mendes  adding  she was such a great writing partner i barely had to speak and she knew exactly what i meant  but cabello  whose album is due this fall  already had fame  fortune and obsessive fans the true gift  after five years of nonstop touring  recording and meetandgreets with 5h  is the taste of freedom  you know that quote  in the silence  you find god  asks cabello  who  in her lace choker  a holey white tee and a black marching band coat  looks like the petite  she is 5foot2  commander of some fun and fashionable army i felt like i could hear everything my heart was telling me  the heart  of course  can be an unreliable guide  and by going solo cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy harmonizers  5h fans  who easily overrun fan polls  like the one for the mtv video music awards 2016 song of the summer contest  in which work from home crushed massive songs by calvin harris and drake  are not to be underestimated  only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career  and she is not an ordinary human she is beyonc  the closer models for cabello may be her fellow talentshow contestants in one direction but none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to  as it seems all young female pop stars must  thread the wholesomeandsexy needle  zayn malik disavowed his past  graffitied his home  cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album  all of which only made him cooler  niall horan took a backpacking trip  rediscovered the 70s folkrock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour  which just made him dreamier  harry styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note  cabello  lest she be judged  must be seductive but pure of heart  strong but vulnerable  selfpossessed but not selfish in a way  girlgroup rules still apply  but that has not stopped her from building on her momentum  and not just by hitting the studio and bringing bad things to the ellen degeneres show with machine gun kelly in january  her first post5h tv appearance  a month after fifth harmonys final televised performance  she has also carefully cultivated her public voice  telling lena dunham in a lenny interview before donald trumps inauguration im going to stick up for immigrants  and im going to stick up for hispanic people and their rights  after trump issued his immigration order  she tweeted  the #muslimban is dehumanizing beyond words im in shock this is not who we are  the easiest route would be to shut my mouth  sing the songs  wear the clothes and keep going  you know says cabello with a jittery laugh  weighing life in 5h against going it alone  i mean  at the peak of our career it is definitely not the safe option but  she says  i have it in my dna the way my mom raised me  it has always been do not settle jump and hope you grow wings on the way down she flings her arms like she is on a roller coaster i feel alive  the lyrics analysis site genius recently determined that cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in fifth harmonys songs even when she was doing the most inside the group  cabello was doing the most outside it  too she started writing on her own early in 5hs career  despite the grueling schedule  her friend taylor swifts red inspired her to make sonic photographs of her changing life  so when she was not cutting parts for 5hs 2013 better together ep at hollywoods record plant  she would be in the studios gym  writing lyrics over other artists melodies about things like my first kiss and my first boyfriend then she got garageband and a midi keyboard  and began churning out shitty demos while touring malls and  in time  arenas  i would wake up super early  says cabello  get off the bus  go to the hotel  put the tv on super loud  i did not want people to hear me fing yelling  then go into the bathroom  put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day  so she was basically singing into the toilet  yep  she has done her 10 00 hours  says cabellos manager roger gold  cofounder of 300 entertainment fifth harmony worked incredibly hard 11andahalf months of the year it was an incredible school  but when it finally came time for cabello to go solo  bitter  previously unhintedat feelings erupted in a shockingly public way  when i ask her about it  cabello does not shy away from discussing the drama of late december 2016  although she clearly means to take the high road  when did the relationship between you and the group start to change  i do not know i was always super open  i could not just sing other peoples words and be totally happy with that you have to follow and honor that inner voice i always encouraged the girls to do the same  do you feel like that changed the relationship  your asserting that  i think that in a group there is always going to be tension  whether it is because of this thing or  thing obviously  i think that rocked the boat  have you been in touch with anyone in 5h since all that went down  no  have you reached out directly i did  yeah i do not want to get into the details of that  because it was really intense and it is hard for me to talk about it makes me sad  when i first heard you were going solo  i was like  im sure there are no hard feelings because this is not a surprise then i was like  what is happening  i had the same reaction i hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other but i only got love for them  cabello took her first vacation in five years on christmas  after her mother  sinuhe  insisted she unplug with the family  including her dad  alejandro  and 9yearold sister  sofia  for three weeks in cancn  the first four days were trippy  says cabello i was stressing about not stressing about something sometimes you are afraid of the quiet like  go  go  go  cabello was raised in havana and  later  mexico city when she was 6  her folks told her they were going to disney world instead  camila and sinu  as she is called  emigrated legally from mexico  spent a day in holding  took a 36hour bus ride to miami and moved in with a friend  alejandro was forced to stay behind  but after a yearandahalf of heartache  he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over sinu was an architect in cuba but found work at a marshalls  stocking shoes alejandro  when he arrived  washed cars at the mall today  they have a successful contracting company  my parents worked really hard  says cabello we always had periods where my dad would be out of a job it was a constant flow of having money  losing everything and then finding a way to get it again if we had food to eat  a roof over our heads and i was going to school  that was enough  alejandro finally got his visa in 2016  and cabello sent her parents to jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had  cabellos florida friends  who all predate her appearance on the x factor  reconnected for friendsgiving in 2016 and facetimed an eighthgrade theater teacher who encouraged cabello when she first got into acting and singing  she is not much for going out i had a phase in miami where i was like  im going to do all the things i would do if i were 19  which she is i went  and i was like  i do not love this  after our brunch in los angeles  she plans to meet troye sivan for coffee and then have him and swift over to her silver lake airbnb for some chill stuff  mainly  cabellos focused on making music  even her hobbies serve the because for song ideas she mines poetry  the book milk and honey  by young feminist rupi kaur  made her cry  novels  currently love in the time of cholera by gabriel garca mrquez  movies  her favorites include the notebook  titanic  romeo + juliet and  above all  the 2001 romcom serendipity  and inspirational quotes she finds on tumblr  she also enjoys practicing guitar  5h player and super close friend ashlee juno gave her daily lessons on the groups 7 27 tour in 2016  romantically speaking  says cabello  i do not have anything going on right now  although she does let slip that literally every boy ive liked has been a scorpio  rumormongers  take note mendes is a leo  and when we start talking about la la land  she winds up telling an unbelievable story  i love the movie because im such a hopeless romantic it made me feel like i could meet anybody anywhere like  yesterday i asked my uber driver for his number because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like  i just came out of a relationship he just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic and i was like  you know what i will get his number he never texted me back what i do not know maybe it did not go through  a few weeks after our brunch  in early february  cabellos in the booth at sphere studios in los angeles  laptop out and notes app open  singing from a file called it is only natural using her achiest coo and a slight patois it is only natural  i need some love from you i might pull up on you it is only human to  want to do da tings we do the vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and jack style edited vocal samples  i never underestimated her talent  but i was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision  says andrew pop wansel  who is known for his work with kehlani and alessia cara  from the control room  it is a real collaboration  chimes in coproducer frank dukes  who has worked with drake and travis scott sometimes it is like a band just jamming  the trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend cabellos love for rihannas anti  i can loop it forever  she says  the era of rbpop that includes alicia keys 2007 song no one  all things shakira and  of course  cuban music  they want to open the lp with a dusty  pianoclanging cut called havana and preview an upbeat caribbean heater that sounds like sia planting a flag in one dance  camila is an incredible songwriter  says epic records chairman ceo antonio la reid  who  with simon cowell  assembled 5h for the x factor and still has cabello on his roster she is working overtime  cabellos mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes sinu is not a momager so much as her daughters right hand and confidante  along with the other members of 5h  she has been by cabellos side the entire time  and now she is the only one left who has seen it all fifth harmony  meanwhile  is soldiering on without cabello  epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017  too  and 5hs peoples choice awards performance of work from home in january was an unmistakable shoulderbrush  as fifth harmony changed the i to we in cabellos opening line  i are not worried about nothing  and punctuated it with a full stop  i know people will try and turn this into  is she going to be more successful outside the group if im growing as an artist  that is success  in april 2016  i interviewed the members of fifth harmony for a billboard cover story  and the chat quickly turned into a teardrenched airing of grievances about the groups toll on their private lives the only one who did not cry was cabello  i was like  oh  my god  this is the saddest thing ive ever seen im sorry about that  she tells me this time around  cabello was not immune to the pressures  just on the mend  fighting anxiety with journaling  exercise  meditation and music i remind her what she told me then  that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her  it is so hard to hear that  says cabello  lowering her head it breaks my heart it is like im watching myself from another persons perspective  like  damn  poor girl  she did finally cry after the turmoil with the group  in miami with her parents and sister and then  she says  i went to the beach a lot i listened only to latin music it reminds me of where i come from and that this  does not have to be world war ii in cuba  people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks  throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity that is real shit not this  i know people will try and turn this into  is she going to be more successful outside the group  continues cabello to me  if im in the studio every day and im growing as an artist and im speaking from my heart  that is success the results do not matter i mean  is not that the goal  if cabello is anxious now  it does not show she seems proud of what 5h was  we represented all different kinds of women coming together  she says fondly  but is candid about what it was not  we did not write our records we were interpreting somebody elses story fifth harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us  and i do not think anybody felt individually represented by the sound  we did not make it,2017.0,2760
