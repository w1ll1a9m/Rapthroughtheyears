honesty is brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i want to make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i going to keep a few punchlines just in case because even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i am back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i are not as big as i was but i am morphing into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do

demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they will be celebrating because i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he is too mainstream well that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it is not hiphop it is popcause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these s that versus you it is curtains i am inadvertently hurting you how many s i going to murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself because i make me do what i put my mind to and i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it is still tongueincheek fuck you i am drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i am going to sleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here is what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life is handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i can not batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,2013.0,1634

honesty is brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i want to make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i going to keep a few punchlines just in case because even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i am back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i are not as big as i was but i am morphing into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad because fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather is pad singing to a man while he played piano man oh man that was the 24 7 special on the cable channel so ray

do to get it through to you i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and i am devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they will be celebrating because i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he is too mainstream well that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it is not hiphop it is popcause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these s that versus you it is curtains i am inadvertently hurting you how many s i going to murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself because i make me do what i put my mind to and i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it is still tongueincheek fuck you i am drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i am going to sleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there is something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here is what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life is handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i can not batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,2014.0,1634

1188,Eminem Featuring Sia,Guts Over Fear, feels like a close it is coming to fuck am i going to do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinking my name was fault cause anytime things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dawg gangster naw courageous balls had to change my style they said i am way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i have been against it it was ingrained in me that i would not amount to a shitstain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just want to play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i do not want to seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon but sometimes you going to take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep plugging it is your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they going to talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like i have already said this a kabillion eighty times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really want to say is is there anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out out out afraid i never before i did not want to go another round an angry man is power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is here guts over fear i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down guts over fear guts over fear feels like a close it is coming to fuck am i going to do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know it is like i was there once single parents hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it was not until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit hard as shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i have caused but what am i going to do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in the trailer park and the window that was closing and there is nowhere else i can go with flows in and i am frozen cause there is no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i made for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but i would rather make not afraid 2 than making another mothafucking we made you uh now i do not want to seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just opened enough eyes later on gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong and enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i can not explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my damn self but on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma cause that gave me the strength to cause shadymania so many empty that stadium at least i made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who all is they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song everything you are scared to say do not be afraid to say no more from this day on forward just let them aholes talk take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when i am gone and to think i was gone afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out out out afraid i never before i did not want to go another round an angry man is power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is here guts over fear i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down guts over fear guts over fear,2014.0,992

1335,Machine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello,Bad Things,cabello kicked off her solo career and her band sisters in fifth harmony unexpectedly denounced her for it now she is got a top five single a muchanticipated album coming and zero second thoughts you have to honor that inner voice camila cabello is late for brunch but not sullen rockstar hidingbehindshades late more like 19yearold mixeduptheaddress late she is running through the dining room of versailles a cuban restaurant deep in los angeles san fernando valley lush black hair streaming apologies pouring forth having just rushed from the other versailles in the city is center as soon as she sits on this midjanuary sunday morning flashing that disarmingly broad smile the singer who was born in cuba resides in miami and is staying in an airbnb here in town says i have got you on what we are going to eat she then proceeds to order in rapidfire spanish a bounty of food lemonades steaks rice beans plantains croquettes flan confusion stress the promise of a splendid feast that has pretty much been the story of cabello is recent life it was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of fifth harmony the most successful girl group since destiny is child with more than 7 million digital songs sold according to nielsen music before the year was out she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates namely that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions and even hatetweets from zealous fans see #camilaisoverparty but that is the confusion and stress during that same time cabello had plenty to celebrate the singer who had collaborated outside of 5h for some time released the darkly sexy rapromp single bad things with machine gun kelly last october and it climbed the charts it is now no 1 on the mainstream top 40 chart and that is not even her first hit i know what you did last summer her 2015 duet with shawn mendes peaked at no 20 on the billboard hot 100 she has social numbers to rival the band is 34 million to 5h is 38 million on twitter and 88 million to 82 million on instagram a guest turn on a major lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems in retrospect like an inevitable transition to solo stardom it would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world says her friend mendes adding she was such a great writing partner i barely had to speak and she knew exactly what i meant but cabello whose album is due this fall already had fame fortune and obsessive fans the true gift after five years of nonstop touring recording and meetandgreets with 5h is the taste of freedom you know that quote in the silence you find god asks cabello who in her lace choker a holey white tee and a black marching band coat looks like the petite she is 5foot2 commander of some fun and fashionable army i felt like i could hear everything my heart was telling me the heart of course can be an unreliable guide and by going solo cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy harmonizers 5h fans who easily overrun fan polls like the one for the mtv video music awards 2016 song of the summer contest in which work from home crushed massive songs by calvin harris and drake are not to be underestimated only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career and she is not an ordinary human she is beyonc the closer models for cabello may be her fellow talentshow contestants in one direction but none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to as it seems all young female pop stars must thread the wholesomeandsexy needle zayn malik disavowed his past graffitied his home cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album all of which only made him cooler niall horan took a backpacking trip rediscovered the 70s folkrock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour which just made him dreamier harry styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note cabello lest she be judged must be seductive but pure of heart strong but vulnerable selfpossessed but not selfish in a way girlgroup rules still apply but that has not stopped her from building on her momentum and not just by hitting the studio and bringing bad things to the ellen degeneres show with machine gun kelly in january her first post5h tv appearance a month after fifth harmony is final televised performance she has also carefully cultivated her public voice telling lena dunham in a lenny interview before donald trump is inauguration i am going to stick up for immigrants and i am going to stick up for hispanic people and their rights after trump issued his immigration order she tweeted the #muslimban is dehumanizing beyond words im in shock this is not who we are the easiest route would be to shut my mouth sing the songs wear the clothes and keep going you know says cabello with a jittery laugh weighing life in 5h against going it alone i mean at the peak of our career it is definitely not the safe option but she says i have it in my dna the way my mom raised me it has always been do not settle jump and hope you grow wings on the way down she flings her arms like she is on a roller coaster i feel alive the lyrics analysis site genius recently determined that cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in fifth harmony is songs even when she was doing the most inside the group cabello was doing the most outside it too she started writing on her own early in 5h is career despite the grueling schedule her friend taylor swift is red inspired her to make sonic photographs of her changing life so when she was not cutting parts for 5h is 2013 better together ep at hollywood is record plant she would be in the studio is gym writing lyrics over other artists melodies about things like my first kiss and my first boyfriend then she got garageband and a midi keyboard and began churning out shitty demos while touring malls and in time arenas i would wake up super early says cabello get off the bus go to the hotel put the tv on super loud i did not want people to hear me fing yelling then go into the bathroom put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day so she was basically singing into the toilet yep she has done her 100 hours says cabello is manager roger gold cofounder of 300 entertainment fifth harmony worked incredibly hard 11andahalf months of the year it was an incredible school but when it finally came time for cabello to go solo bitter previously unhintedat feelings erupted in a shockingly public way when i ask her about it cabello does not shy away from discussing the drama of late december 2016 although she clearly means to take the high road when did the relationship between you and the group start to change i do not know i was always super open i could not just sing other people is words and be totally happy with that you have to follow and honor that inner voice i always encouraged the girls to do the same do you feel like that changed the relationship your asserting that i think that in a group there is always going to be tension whether it is because of this thing or thing obviously i think that rocked the boat have you been in touch with anyone in 5h since all that went down no have you reached out directly i did yeah i do not want to get into the details of that because it was really intense and it is hard for me to talk about it makes me sad when i first heard you were going solo i was like i am sure there are no hard feelings because this is not a surprise then i was like what is happening i had the same reaction i hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other but i only got love for them cabello took her first vacation in five years on christmas after her mother sinuhe insisted she unplug with the family including her dad alejandro and 9yearold sister sofia for three weeks in cancn the first four days were trippy says cabello i was stressing about not stressing about something sometimes you are afraid of the quiet like go go go cabello was raised in havana and later mexico city when she was 6 her folks told her they were going to disney world instead camila and sinu as she is called emigrated legally from mexico spent a day in holding took a 36hour bus ride to miami and moved in with a friend alejandro was forced to stay behind but after a yearandahalf of heartache he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over sinu was an architect in cuba but found work at a marshalls stocking shoes alejandro when he arrived washed cars at the mall today they have a successful contracting company my parents worked really hard says cabello we always had periods where my dad would be out of a job it was a constant flow of having money losing everything and then finding a way to get it again if we had food to eat a roof over our heads and i was going to school that was enough alejandro finally got his visa in 2016 and cabello sent her parents to jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had cabello is florida friends who all predate her appearance on the x factor reconnected for friendsgiving in 2016 and facetimed an eighthgrade theater teacher who encouraged cabello when she first got into acting and singing she is not much for going out i had a phase in miami where i was like i am going to do all the things i would do if i were 19 which she is i went and i was like i do not love this after our brunch in los angeles she plans to meet troye sivan for coffee and then have him and swift over to her silver lake airbnb for some chill stuff mainly cabello is focused on making music even her hobbies serve the cause for song ideas she mines poetry the book milk and honey by young feminist rupi kaur made her cry novels currently love in the time of cholera by gabriel garca mrquez movies her favorites include the notebook titanic romeo + juliet and above all the 2001 romcom serendipity and inspirational quotes she finds on tumblr she also enjoys practicing guitar 5h player and super close friend ashlee juno gave her daily lessons on the group is 7 27 tour in 2016 romantically speaking says cabello i do not have anything going on right now although she does let slip that literally every boy i have liked has been a scorpio rumormongers take note mendes is a leo and when we start talking about la la land she winds up telling an unbelievable story i love the movie because i am such a hopeless romantic it made me feel like i could meet anybody anywhere like yesterday i asked my uber driver for his number because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like i just came out of a relationship he just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic and i was like you know what i will get his number he never texted me back what i do not know maybe it did not go through a few weeks after our brunch in early february cabello is in the booth at sphere studios in los angeles laptop out and notes app open singing from a file called it is only natural using her achiest coo and a slight patois it is only natural i need some love from you i might pull up on you it is only human to want to do da tings we do the vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and jack style edited vocal samples i never underestimated her talent but i was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision says andrew pop wansel who is known for his work with kehlani and alessia cara from the control room it is a real collaboration chimes in coproducer frank dukes who has worked with drake and travis scott sometimes it is like a band just jamming the trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend cabello is love for rihanna is anti i can loop it forever she says the era of randbpop that includes alicia keys 2007 song no one all things shakira and of course cuban music they want to open the lp with a dusty pianoclanging cut called havana and preview an upbeat caribbean heater that sounds like sia planting a flag in one dance camila is an incredible songwriter says epic records chairman ceo antonio la reid who with simon cowell assembled 5h for the x factor and still has cabello on his roster she is working overtime cabello is mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes sinu is not a momager so much as her daughter is right hand and confidante along with the other members of 5h she has been by cabello is side the entire time and now she is the only one left who has seen it all fifth harmony meanwhile is soldiering on without cabello epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017 too and 5h is people is choice awards performance of work from home in january was an unmistakable shoulderbrush as fifth harmony changed the i to we in cabello is opening line i are not worried about nothinggg and punctuated it with a full stop i know people will try and turn this into is she going to be more successful outside the group if i am growing as an artist that is success in april 2016 i interviewed the members of fifth harmony for a billboard cover story and the chat quickly turned into a teardrenched airing of grievances about the group is toll on their private lives the only one who did not cry was cabello i was like oh my god this is the saddest thing i have ever seen i am sorry about that she tells me this time around cabello was not immune to the pressures just on the mend fighting anxiety with journaling exercise meditation and music i remind her what she told me then that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her it is so hard to hear that says cabello lowering her head it breaks my heart it is like i am watching myself from another person is perspective like damn poor girl she did finally cry after the turmoil with the group in miami with her parents and sister and then she says i went to the beach a lot i listened only to latin music it reminds me of where i come from and that this does not have to be world war ii in cuba people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity that is real shit not this i know people will try and turn this into is she going to be more successful outside the group continues cabello to me if i am in the studio every day and i am growing as an artist and i am speaking from my heart that is success the results do not matter i mean is not that the goal if cabello is anxious now it does not show she seems proud of what 5h was we represented all different kinds of women coming together she says fondly but is candid about what it was not we did not write our records we were interpreting somebody else is story fifth harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us and i do not think anybody felt individually represented by the sound we did not make it,2017.0,2803
