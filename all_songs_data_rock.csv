54,,,The Dirty Heads Featuring Rome,[],"EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT  A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.  The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road.  INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT  The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over.  DRIVER Goddamn bugs.  The camera shows the back of the van, where seven illegal immigrants wait. The driver squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, and then sees something worse up ahead. Headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.  He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van.  DRIVER (CONT'D) Oh shit! Deja me hablar. Oh crap!  EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT  The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with ""INS"" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window.  The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs.  AGENT JANUS Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where you comin' from?  DRIVER I was fishing in Cuernavaca.  AGENT JANUS Sure you were. What do you say we have a look at your catch, huh? [opens the door] Come on.  AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,  the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head.  AGENT JANUS Me, I woulda thrown 'em back. (to the passengers, in Spanish) Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina! (Let's go. Out. Form a line!)  They pile out of the van.  AGENT JANUS (CONT'D) What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna need it.  Another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons.  The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.  TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents.  KAY We'll take it from here.  AGENT JANUS Who the hell are you?  Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.  KAY INS Division 6.  AGENT JANUS Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.  KAY Really?  Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.  KAY (CONT'D) What're we thinking, Dee?  DEE Tough call, Kay.  He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in subtitled Spanish.  KAY !Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey! (What's up, how are you?) Abuela, no se preocupe, . Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos. (Don't worry grandma. Welcome to the United States.) A donde vas? Nogales? Buscando trabajo, no? Tu, lo mismo? (Where are you going? Nogales?  Looking for work?  You too?) Y tu? Es un placer verle aqui. (And you? It's a pleasure seeing you here.)  One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:  KAY (CONT'D) Que dices si te rompo la cara? (What do you say if I break your face?)  The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy's shoulder.  KAY (CONT'D) Es muy feo, no? Y no hablas ni una palabra del Español! (You're very ugly, aren't you? You don't speak a word of Spanish!)  Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.  KAY (CONT'D) We got a winner here, Dee  DEE  (also laughing) Oh, I know!  KAY (CONT'D) (to the others) Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense! (The rest of you are free to go. Scram!)  AGENT JANUS No se mueven! (Don't move!)  KAY Tomen el camion, y vayeuse. (Get on the road and go.)  AGENT JANUS Sir! Sir, you can't just --  KAY Don't ""Sir"" me! You have no idea who you're dealing with!  Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.  KAY (CONT'D) (to Janus) We're gonna have a little chat with our friend here. You boys can hit the road ... and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens.  Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.  AGENT JANUS You ever heard of Division 6?  2ND INS AGENT There is no Division 6. This is bullshit.  AGENT JANUS Yeah.  EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT  Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush.  KAY Looks like you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet dollars to pesos that you're not from anywhere near here.  He pulls out a knife, and cuts the man's poncho. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- an amphibian/reptile with two independent eyes and he also appeared to have a shell on his back, which had six small arms and hands. The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the humanesque ""head,""  which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it.  KAY (CONT'D) Mikey?!  MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and saliva.  KAY (CONT'D) Mikey?!  When did they let you out of jail?  Mikey replies.  KAY (CONT'D) Political refugee. Right.  DEE You know how many treaties articles you've just violated?  Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.  KAY One?  DEE Try seven.  Mikey continues to talk.  KAY (off Mikey's objections) That's enough, Mikey. Hand me that head.  Mikey delivers the head prop.  KAY Now put up your arms and all your flippers.  As Mike continues to talk, Janus is climbing a hill behind them. He lets out a terrified GASP. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. As the eye returns to place...  KAY (CONT'D) Ah, shit.  Mikey gets mad and changes into an angry stance, with all flippers shaking this, and gets very mad. He knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus, SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech as Agent Janus SCREAMS and freezes, terrified.  KAY (CONT'D) Dee! Shoot him!  Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground.  KAY (CONT'D) Dee!  Kay drops the head, puts his hand inside the jacket. Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide open --  -- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --  -- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay stands, smoking weapon in hand, and sighs.  EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT  Janus walks further into the clearing. Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.  AGENT JANUS Th -- th -- th --  KAY (helping) ""That.""  AGENT JANUS That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --  KAY Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you there, pal.  The INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.  KAY Okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. If you'll just give me your attention for a moment I'll tell you what happened.  From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.  KAY (CONT'D) This is called a ""neuralyzer."" A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory.  Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.  KAY (CONT'D) Fellas, give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80 meters. Right here! Thank you!  TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black. The Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.  2ND INS AGENT What in the hell is going on?!  Kay moves the dials on the Neuralyzer's back.  KAY Excellent question. The answer you're looking for lies right here.  JANUS Who are you, really?  KAY Really? [puts on sunglasses] I'm just a figment of your imagination.  He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay  pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.  KAY (CONT'D) God, we're a gullible breed.  Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion.  KAY (CONT'D) I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that.  The Agents look around, confused.  AGENT JANUS What -- blast?  KAY Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.  He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.  KAY (CONT'D) Especially you.  Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.  DEE I'm sorry. About...back there.  KAY Happens.  DEE Didn't used to.  He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.  DEE (CONT'D) The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me...  He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.  DEE (CONT'D) They're beautiful, aren't they?  KAY What?  DEE The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore. (back to Kay) I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase. I will miss the chase.  Kay puts the sunglasses, pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.  KAY No. You won't.  EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT  A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN DOWN TO...  A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.  A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.  Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt.  EDWARDS Stop! NYPD!  He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS, overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.  COP All yours, Edwards!  The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.  TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP  As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties. The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first Street below.  EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He, too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...  EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT  A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.  EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...  EDWARDS What the hell? It just be raining black people in New York.  With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs out through the side door.  He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.  Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.  EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT  THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into frame and pushes him towards a wall.  EDWARDS Do you see this? N.Y.P.D.! It means I will knock your punk-ass down!  The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.  PERP He's coming! He's coming!  EDWARDS And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass too.  Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp pulls out his WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand. THE WEAPON smashes into the ground and explodes in fire.  EDWARDS You trying to catch a beat down?  As Edwards tries to ram his head on the wall, The Perp walks on it to backflip and land safely on his feet and take off again. Edwards hits the wall, and then goes runs after him.  The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the Perp is gone.  EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT  Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it, and in the next instant...  The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.  Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and runs inside.  He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.  EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT  On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's locked.  He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --  -- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon at the Perp.  EDWARDS Wassup?  PERP He's coming! He's coming because I failed, and now he'll kill me too!  EDWARDS You pissing everybody off today, huh?  PERP You don't understand. Your world is gonna end.  The Perp blinks with another set of translucent, milky white eyelids, from the side of his eyeballs. Edwards is thrown off.  EDWARDS What are you?  The Perp backpedals, toward the edge of the roof.  EDWARDS Watch that ledge.Watch it.Come down. We'll get those eyes fixed.Don't even worry about it. Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!  But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and starts to fall over, crashing to the ground.  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT  A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm country. A truck is parked in the driveway, and a cow grazes next to it. A Man (EDGAR)'s voice is heard.  EDGAR (O.S.) I go out, I work my butt off to make a living, all I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but instead I get this -- this -- I don't even know what you call this!  In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.  EDGAR (O.S.) I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't it?!  No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors. The cow starts to walk away from the truck.  EDGAR (O.S.) I swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been hit enough, I can't make up my mind.  Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.  The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --  EDGAR (O.S.) You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!  -- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.  The door opens. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun.  EDGAR Figures.  Edgar walks across the yard, going into the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.  BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.  BEATRICE What is it, Edgar?!  EDGAR (turns to her) Get your big butt back in that house!  Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar approaches the hole. AN OTHERWORLDLY  VOICE comes from deep in the hole.  VOICE (O.S.) Place projectile weapon on ground.  Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.  EDGAR You can have my gun [cocks it] when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!  The voice responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.  VOICE (O.S.) Your proposal is acceptable.  A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole.  From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck.  It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom.  The thing is pulled back... and Edgar comes out, but rugged and dirty, and makes a sound as he moves his jaw.  CUT TO:  INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT  BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table. Edgar first hits the panel door, then opens it. He carries the shotgun. She looks up at him. But his face is a blank.  BEATRICE What on earth was it?!  He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined.  EDGAR Sugar.  BEATRICE I've never seen sugar do that.  EDGAR Give me sugar.  Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him.  EDGAR (CONT'D) In water.  Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it.  EDGAR (CONT'D) More.  She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.  Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.  BEATRICE Edgar, your skin is hanging off your bones.  Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He turns around, reaches up --  -- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, by pulling his hair up and stretching his whole face.  EDGAR That better?  Beatrice faints.  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT  The cow observes as a loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship. The flying saucer is rolled out of the pit by Edgar.   CUT TO:  INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT  EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him.  INSPECTOR Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?  EDWARDS No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set.  SERGEANT Sort of a low beam, high beam.  INSPECTOR Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces?  EDWARDS After, sir.  INSPECTOR And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events?  EDWARDS 'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn't keep up, sir.  SERGEANT Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am --  EDWARDS What do you mean? I am half the man you are.  SERGEANT What the hell is your problem?  EDWARDS My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time.  SERGEANT I think he threw him off the roof.  EDWARDS Maybe you're next.  INSPECTOR (cutting off the Sergeant) Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now.  SERGEANT Ten minutes -- take your best shot.  EDWARDS Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.  A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him.  LAUREL I believe you. [extends her hand, Edwards grabs it] Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. Find me at the morgue on 26th. I'll tell you what I found.  EDWARDS Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  He turns around, but she's already in the corridor behind the room, but is STOPPED by someone who remains in shadow.  SHADOW (O.S.) You're Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office? Working on the John Doe?  LAUREL Yes. That's right.  SHADOW (O.S.) Would you look right here, please.  A red flash hits Laurel, who keeps still on the hallway. Then KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. As he goes to the security camera to turn it off by the power cable...  KAY Some night, huh?  EDWARDS Oh, yeah, some night.  KAY They were gills. Not eyelids. Gills. He was out of breath.  EDWARDS Who are you?  KAY Did he say anything to you?  EDWARDS (scoffing) Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to an end.  KAY Did he say when?  Silence, as Edwards stares in disbelief.  KAY Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?  EDWARDS Absolutely.  KAY Let's take a ride.  EDWARDS Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.  KAY It's all done.  At that point, the INSPECTOR appears with a folder, smiles and gives Edwards the thumbs up.  INSPECTOR Good work, Edwards.  Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.  KAY You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough. That's double tough.  CUT TO:  INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING  A plain, boxy Ford approaches a pawn shop. Kay and Edwards' voices are heard inside it.  EDWARDS So who you with?  KAY I'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth.  EDWARDS Whatever.  KAY We're here.  Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.  EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT  Edwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.  EDWARDS This is where we're going?  KAY Yeah.  EDWARDS This is Jack Jeebs' spot. He buys from chain snatchers. Doesn't even sell guns.  KAY Really?  EDWARDS All right, you think it's worth shaking him up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some answers.  KAY Do your ""thing,"" kid.  Edwards goes inside.  INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT  JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not easily intimidated.  JEEBS Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the proper authorities.  He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.  EDWARDS Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.  JEEBS Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just work here because I love the hours.  This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.  EDWARDS (getting angry) I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech stuff.  JEEBS C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.  Kay walks into the room.  KAY Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.  At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.  JEEBS H-hiya Kay, how are you?  KAY The imports, Jeebs. Now.  JEEBS You know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay.  KAY Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie.  He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.  JEEBS Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...  KAY I'm going to count to three.  Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.  EDWARDS He'll do it, Jeebs.  KAY One.  EDWARDS I've seen him do it.  KAY Two.  EDWARDS Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this.  JEEBS He's always crazy. (to Kay) Take a cruise. Get a massage --  KAY Three.  KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor. Edwards is shocked.  Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.  EDWARDS Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter!  KAY I warned him.  EDWARDS Drop the weapon!  KAY You warned him.  EDWARDS You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.  KAY Will you relax?  JEEBS (O.S.) (irritated, in a helium voice)You insensitive prick!  Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs' baby-soft new cheek.  JEEBS (CONT'D) Do you know how much that stings?  KAY Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one.  Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk --  -- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes.  KAY Edwards?  Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. He recognizes one.  EDWARDS Uh, this. This is what I saw.  Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.  KAY You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.  JEEBS He looked all right to me.  KAY A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target?  JEEBS I don't know.  Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.  KAY Jeebs!  JEEBS I don't know!  Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.  KAY This is all confiscated. All of it. I want you on the next transport off this rock. Or I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.  Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.  EDWARDS Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.  Shaken, Edwards follows.  EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT  Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight in his head.  KAY Searching for a handle on the moment here? I can't help you, kid.  Kay pulls the sunglasses from his pocket and puts them on.  KAY (cont'd) Only comfort I can offer is my promise that tomorrow morning  you won't remember a thing.  EDWARDS That's not exactly some shit you just forget.  He shows the Neuralyzer to Edwards.  KAY Ever see one of these?  CUT TO:  INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT  -- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant.  KAY (finishing a joke) -- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but this one's eating my popcorn!  He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.  EDWARDS Huh?  Kay checks his watch.  KAY Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.  EDWARDS Where am I?  KAY See what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m. sharp.  He gives a business card before leaving the restaurant.  Edward sees the card, it's just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card: ""MiB"". Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and sees "" 504 Battery Drive.""  DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. GARAGE - DAY  A pest control van, reading ""Zap Em"", approaches a garage.  INT GARAGE - DAY  The door opens on a garage. The morning light spills on an abundance of cockroaches, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. An EXTERMINATOR steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas.  EXTERMINATOR Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we? Think we own the place?  He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.  EXTERMINATOR(CONT'D) Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.  He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.  VOICE (O.S.) Just what exactly do you think you're doing?  The Exterminator turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully.  EXTERMINATOR (shrugs) Takin' care of your pest problem.  EDGAR ""Pest"" problem? ""Pest?""  EXTERMINATOR Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.  Edgar advances on him, slowly.  EDGAR You know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.  EXTERMINATOR Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of 'em?  EDGAR In the worst way.  Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Exterminator's face with one hand  and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. He falls dead on the floor.   EXT. GARAGE - DAY  The Zap-Em truck now has the rear door down and the ramp standing. Edgar rolls the flying saucer towards it.  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY  The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him: the ventilation tower of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which connects Manhattan with Brooklyn.  INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY  EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding metal chair halfway across. A symbol resembling an atom nucleus is on the floor.  Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.  GUARD Help you?  EDWARDS Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --  GUARD Elevator.  And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator. As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY  Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. The elevato moves for a while as Jay stares at the card, and then door on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him.  From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and finds himself standing in --  INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY  This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway. Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at Edwards.  One chair is empty.  ZED You're late. Sit down.  Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed continues addressing the Recruits.  ZED (CONT'D) My name is Zed. You're all here because you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.  They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.  ZED (CONT'D) And we're looking for one of you. Just one. What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills, hand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina -- I see we have a question.  Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.  EDWARDS Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this?  Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls on him.  ZED Son?  AMBITIOUS RECRUIT (loud and formal) Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with honors. We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!  Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.  ZED What's so funny, Edwards?  EDWARDS Your boy, Captain America, here. ""The best of the best of the best, sir!'' ''With honors.'' He's just really excited, and he has no clue why we're here. That's very funny to me. Y'all ain't laughing, though.  EDWARDS Want to get down on this?  ZED Okay. Let's get going.  The recruits get the written test. It's a thick document -- reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  EDWARDS is struggling to just open it: he rips through the first page, and then breaks the pencil trying to break the tape holding it together.  Behind the dark glass, Kay stands, staring, unemotional.  The RECRUITS are all struggling to get a place to write in their chairs, given no desks were provided. One even has his pencil TEAR through the page.  Edwards looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table. Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --  -- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.  Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.  EDWARDS Want to get down on this?  They stare silently.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY  SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. A claxon rings, and it's shown the SEVEN RECRUITS are in front of the table. The two far walls pull apart. The whole room starts being covered in stroboscopic lights, while an urban landscape featuring human and alien carboard figures shows. The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim.  Everyone but Edwards shoots. And then a second later, he fires. The lights come down. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.  ZED The hell happened?  EDWARDS Hesitated, sir.  Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl.  ZED May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?  EDWARDS She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time.  ZED And how did you come to that conclusion?  EDWARDS First, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight but I realized he's just working out. How'd I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?Then I saw this snarling beast guy, and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand. Ain't no real threat there. Then I saw Tiffany. I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto... bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books. She about to start some shit, Zed. She's about eight. Those books are way too advanced for her. If you ask me, she's up to something.  Honestly, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.  Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.  EDWARDS (CONT'D) Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?  Zed walks away.  EDWARDS That was a good shot though, right?  Uncomfortable looks.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY  ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.  ZED He's got a real problem with authority.  KAY So do I. But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss. That's got to be tough enough.  ZED I hope you know what you're doing.  Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.  Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.  ZED (CONT'D) Congratulations, you're everything we've come to expect from years of government training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY  The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.  KAY is outside the door, waiting for him.  KAY Where are you going?  Edwards recognizes him from last night and walks towards him.  EDWARDS You! Hey, what's goin' on?  Once Edwards approaches, Kay gives him a folder. Both start walking down the corridor.  KAY Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.  As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket.  ZED Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device.  He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.  Edwards then turns to the folder, and starts reading from it. As Kay talks and both walk, Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES.  KAY Everybody thought the agency was a joke. Except the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.  Cut to Edwards' point of view - the folder has thick with eight by ten photographs. He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights... and one young man resembling young KAY in a plaid shirt holding a bouquet.  KAY (CONT'D) There were nine of us that night. Seven agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.  Yet another photograph, this one showing the young man  giving the tall alien the flowers.  EDWARDS Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.  Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first.  KAY They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet.  Ever see ""Casablanca?"" [Edwards replies yes] Same thing, no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing.  Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.  EDWARDS So these are real flying saucers and the World's Fair was a cover-up for their landing?  KAY Why else would we hold it in Queens? (another hallway) More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.  EDWARDS I see. Not to change the subject, but when was your last CAT scan?  KAY Every six months; it's company policy.  EDWARDS Make another appointment. Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time and thank you for everything but show me the door.  They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps inside.  KAY All right. I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?  EDWARDS No, thank you, I'm fine.  As Kay walks into the kitchenette, THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of Esperanto and microphone feedback. One holds the coffee pot, another drinks and smokes.  KAY How you doing, fellas?  WORMS Hi Kay!  Kay grabs a paper cup, approaches the one with the pot.  KAY That's not decaf, is it?  WORM Viennese cinnamon.  KAY Don't tell me we've only got that powdered stuff for cream again?  One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter.  KAY (CONT'D) Well, that's good. Good. Good.  He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee.  KAY You guys getting along all right?  They reply in their language.  KAY Don't work too hard.  He comes back outside, closing the door behind him.  WORM So, you guys seen the cahuengas on...  Kay approaches the slack-jawed Edwards.  KAY (CONT'D) Sure you don't want coffee?  WORM Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?  As the worms laugh, the scene cuts.  CUT TO:  EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY  EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.  KAY Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.  EDWARDS Cab drivers?  KAY Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one, either. They're happy. They think they've got a pretty good bead on things.  EDWARDS Why the big secret? People are smart, they can handle it.  KAY A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. You know it.  A thousand years ago everybody knew Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.  Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.  EDWARDS So what's the catch?  KAY The catch.The catch is you will sever every human contact. Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere. Ever. l give you to sunrise to think it over.  Kay gets up and walks away.  EDWARDS Is it worth it?  KAY Yeah, it's worth it... if you're strong enough.  DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK  Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.  Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.  CUT TO:  EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING  We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.  We see the Zap Em van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY  EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday. The guard is still there.  EDWARDS What's up, pops?  The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.  EDWARDS One thing you gotta know right now.  Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY  Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.  EDWARDS All right. I'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills. I don't want nobody calling me ""son"" or ""kid"" or ""sport."" Cool?  KAY Whatever you say, slick. But I need to tell you something about all your skills. As of right now...  The elevator doors --  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  -- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.  KAY ...they mean precisely dick.  It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers.  KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place.  Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues.  Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.  PASSPORT OFFICER Purpose of trip?  ARQUILLIAN Diplomatic mission.  PASSPORT OFFICER Duration of stay?  ARQUILLIAN Lunch.  PASSPORT OFFICER Carrying any fruits or vegetables?  As Edwards passes by an alien resembling a giant slub and just stares, fascinated, Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along.  KAY Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.  Kay moves him into the central hall.  KAY Three-hour delay in customs after a 17 trillion mile flight gonna make anybody cranky. Right?  EDWARDS What branch of the government do we report to?  KAY None. They ask too many questions.  EDWARDS So who pays for all this?  KAY Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.  AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.  KAY (picking something up) This is a fascinating little gadget. A new recording device to replace CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album again.  (something else) This is amusing. Universal translator.  He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone.  KAY (CONT'D) We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell you why.  Human thought is so primitive it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies. That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?  Edwards touches up a small yellow ball that stands floating above a torch-like device.  EDWARDS What's this?  THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex -- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can follow --  VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of its way. One experiment room has all the beakers and such breaking. In Zed's office, the boss barely notices the bouncing ball.  EDWARDS (to various people as the ball approaches or hits them) Relax! Watch your head!  Somebody get him some ice.Move! Just move when it's coming at you!Damn! I'm going to pay for that!  ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove over his right hand...  He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the ball, calmly.  KAY (CONT'D) Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.  They leave the room.  EDWARDS Sorry! It was a accident. Sorry.  ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall.  KAY Observation, the heart of our little endeavor. Meet the twins. Idikiukup and Bob.  Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around and wave two or three arms each.  The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.  KAY (CONT'D) This map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time. Some of them we keep under constant surveillance.  He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by ten big screens.  KAY (CONT'D) Everyone on these screens is an alien. In public -- normal. In private -- you'll get the idea.  ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of ten humans who are actually aliens.  EDWARDS Oh, man.  KAY It makes no sense?  EDWARDS It makes perfect sense.When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...  but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.  KAY Mrs. Edelson.Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.  Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots ""Irma Edelson""  onto the screen.  EDELSON Class...  be quiet and pay attention! If I have to tell you one more time--  ZED's voice is then heard.  ZED (O.S.) Edwards!  Edwards turns around  ZED Let's put it on.  EDWARDS Put what on?  ZED The last suit you'll ever wear.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY  The MIB locker room is all gray, each locker with a single letter. Edwards approaches a locker reading ""J"". ZED'S VOICE comes over:  ZED (O.S.) From now on, you'll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services.  EDWARDS takes out revealing a BLACK SUIT hung from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a WHITE SHIRT, a WRISTWATCH and a pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything.  One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.  ZED'S VOICE continues:  ZED (O.S.) You'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you.  INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY  EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.  He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.  ZED (O.S.) You will have no identifying marks of any kind.  You will not stand out in any way. Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter.  INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY   Feet slip into black shoes.  ZED (O.S.) You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't exist; you were never even born.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.  The watch is put on the wrist.  ZED (O.S.) Anonymity is your name. Silence your native tongue.  More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads ""JAMES DARREL ED..."" then ""JAMES DARR...""  The glasses are removed and put on the coat's pocket.  ZED (O.S.) You are no longer part of ""the system.""  ""JAMES..."" ""JAM...""  ZED (O.S.) We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.  A tie pushed up. The earring is removed.  ZED (O.S.) We're ""them."" We're ""they.""  On screen, all that's left is the letter ""J.""  ZED (O.S.) We are the Men in Black.  Kay's screen reads ""New Entry: J. Database Updated"" as the atom logo shows in the background. Jay's voice is heard.  JAY (O.S.) The difference between you and me?  Kay moves. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS III -- or, rather, JAY -- reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and slips 'em on.  JAY (CONT'D) I make this look good.  CUT TO:  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Out of one of the ""Rosenberg Fine Jewelry"" shops on Thirty-Fifth Street comes a short, old man (ROSENBERG), carrying a bag with a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. He talks to the cat.  ROSENBERG We're going to go for a ride. I'll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.  Carefully, he puts the bag on a pane with flowers as he locks the revolving door to his distinctive shop.  The Zap-Em Truck then approaches the shop. The cat stares at Edgar as he struggles to position itself in a ""not-suspicious"" position.  ROSENBERG Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.  That finished, Rosenberg picks up the bag, puts the box in his pocket, then waddles off down the street.  ROSENBERG We're going to meet with Daddy's friend who you'll like.  Edgar then starts the van and moves it along.  INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY  Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are six video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image.  While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.  ZED Okay, let's see. (to one of the monitors) Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.  BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.  BEE Humanoid?  ZED You wish. Bring a sponge. (going through memos) And here. Red-letter from last night -- we had an un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country. Keep your ears open for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a galactic kegger down here.  Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.  ZED Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.  KAY (to Jay) Landed alien out of zone. (to Zed) Who is it?  ZED Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan but he's way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why don't you take junior with you? This is a good one for him to warm up on.  Kay gets up.  ZED (to Jay) Go get 'em, Tiger.  Zed then looks again that the monitor reporting on Redgick.  EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY  JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.  JAY (imitating Zed) ""We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger...""  Kay frowns at him.  JAY Zed. He just...  An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door open. Jay sizes up the car.  JAY Unlimited technology from the whole universe... and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.  INT. MIB LTD - DAY  They get in and slam the doors. Kay fastens his seatbelt.  KAY Fasten seat belt.  He  starts the car and the engine HUMS quietly.  JAY We got to work on your people skills. You'd get a much better reaction if you were more polite.  Kay shifts on reverse, glares at Jay and extends his hands above the wheel.  KAY Fasten seat belts, please.  JAY Good. Did you hurt yourself?  Kay steps on the gas. The awesome power of the car kicks in and Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.  Jay's hand falls by accident on a lever between the seats, with a big red button on it.  KAY Oh, the red button there. Don't ever, ever touch it.  Jay jerks his hand away.  CUT TO:  EXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY  The exterior of R&L, a Russian diner. A cab stops on the door, ROSENBERG steps out of it.  CAB DRIVER All right, pop,that'll be $72   there.  Rosenberg puts the bag with the cat atop the taxi.  ROSENBERG Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.  A moment later, the Zap-Em van pulls to a stop across the street.  INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY  ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties. The man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a ""diplomatic mission"" from passport control) rises from his chair.  Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, puts the bag on the floor, but does not sit down. He and ROSENBERG embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion.  Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled.  ROSENBERG Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.  ARQUILLIAN Your majesty, you are in grave danger.  ROSENBERG Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.  ARQUILLIAN Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet.  ROSENBERG A bug? He must know why I'm here.  ARQUILLIAN We think he does.(noticing the ornate box on the table) Is that what I think it is?  ROSENBERG No, just some diamonds for your children. Do we have time to eat?  The Arquillian relaxes.  ARQUILLIAN Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.  INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY  In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter --  COOK Table six is up!  He sees someone approaching...  COOK Where is Ivan?  VOICE (O.S.) Gave him a break.  The voice is suspiciously like Edgar's. The cook turns away to his grill. A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, one with each hand. We follow, but see only the arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it.  As he steps away, we see a storage shelf crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed tomatoes --  -- and the DEAD IVAN, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the shelves.  INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY  ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast. Now it's clear that the waiter approaching in the background is Edgar.  ARQUILLIAN To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.  ROSENBERG To the safety of the galaxy.  They CLINK glasses and drink, just as Edgar arrives. The plates are put down. Close in on Rosenberg's, from his POV, catching a glimpse of the Waiter's hand --  -- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve and scurries in the dish. Rosenberg looks up to the waiter's face, paralyzed with fear. He seems to know what dire implications Edgar's presence holds.  ROSENBERG (in English again) You can kill us both -- but you will not find it.  The Arquilian looks at Edgar, is also afraid. Rosenberg's cat is seen  raising his head on the bag.  EDGAR You're right about one thing.  Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and zips under the table. It hits Rosenberg's neck, and then the Arquillian. Both lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain. They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.  Edgar moves quickly, grabs the ornate box, and leaves, flipping a table on the way. Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes. He turns around and grunts at the cat, who proceeds to angrily make a defying gesture. We can see his collar reads ""ORION"" before the cat hisses again.  Edgar turns around and walks further towards the exit. Another waiter moves to the  door frame.  MAN You're not going anywhere, pal.  Edgar tosses him away, making the waiter's tray loudly fall and make noise. Edgar then pushes the door and walks down the street, with the patron next to the door staring.  PASSERBY What's going on?  Edgar just hits and makes the man fall.  EXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY Edgar is walking down the street, holding his hip and stretching his arm. The restaurant staff are all gathering at the door to stare at him, as does another man passing by the street.  INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY The cat stares angrily.  CUT TO:  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY  A car has pulled over. KAY  approaches the DRIVER.  KAY License and registration, please.  The Driver hands over some documents.  KAY (O.S.) Other license and registration, please.  The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over Kay's shoulder.  KAY You're restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?  REDGICK It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!  It can be seen the back seat that MRS. REDGICK, with a big belly, lies down, MOANING in pain, making contraction gestures.  KAY All right. No big deal.  He opens the door.  KAY (cont'd) Okay, you come with me, Redge.  Redgwick steps out the car, looks at his screaming wife one last time. Kay closes the door, turns to Jay.  KAY You handle it.  JAY What? Me?  Kay approaches Redgwick.  KAY Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.  REDGICK He knows what he's doing?  KAY He does it all the time. Let the man work.  INT. REDGWICK'S CAR - DAY  From Mrs. Redgwick's point of view, her open legs and Jay outside the door.  He smiles, gestures happily, and then does an imitation of the ""breathing lesson in Lamaze class"". Then he looks down to the woman's crotch...  JAY Kay! Damn, man! So-- Something's peaking!  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him. The car has all sorts of stuff above the trunk, so nothing inside the cabin can be seen. A TENTACLE whips out from inside the car, wraps around Jay and pulls him. He struggles trying to get released. The other two never break their conversation.  KAY Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town.  REDGICK Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.  KAY (still to Redgick) So? Who you meeting?  REDGICK Well, it's -- a ship.  KAY Really? I didn't see a departure clearance for today.  REDGICK You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.  The tentacle starts dangling Jay upside down above the car.  JAY Kay! Kay!  KAY You're doing fine, ace.  JAY Kiss my ass!  KAY (back to Redgick) What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?  Jay is pulled inside the car. And then as the vehicle shakes he emerges still wrapped on the tentacle through the other side.  REDGICK We just don't like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals.  Jay starts being bashed on the car ceiling.  KAY New arrivals? Have anything to do with the crasher from last night?  Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away. Jay is pulled inside the car again.  JAY (Screaming) Excuse me, miss! But in that moment, Jay is ejected with great speed from inside the car. Redge runs towards him. Jay falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled squidlike baby resting squarely on his chest.  JAY (CONT'D) Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.  Kay and Redgwick approach. Kay claps him on the back.  KAY Congratulations, Redge! It's a squid.  Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.  JAY (misty) He's... actually kind of...  It vomits slime on him. Jay spits the one that fell in his mouth, and then the ""squid"" blinks.  JAY ...cute.  CUT TO:  EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY  Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car.  KAY Anything about that seem unusual to you?  Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.   KAY What kind of ""new arrival"" would scare Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn? (thinks) Let's check the hot sheets.  EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY  CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. There are headlines like ""POPE A FATHER!""and ""TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY BORN PREGNANT!"" and ""MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!"" (the subhead on that one is ""And That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor."")  KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.  JAY These are the hot sheets?  Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck.  KAY Best investigative reporting on the planet.  Read the New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.  JAY I cannot believe you're looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid.  KAY Not looking for. Found.  He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming:  Farm wife says ""ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!""  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY  The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts up the driveway.  KAY Wait, slow down.  JAY Why?  KAY Give her time to get the wrong impression. Makes things smoother.  BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.  Beatrice calls to them.  BEATRICE Can I help you gentlemen?  KAY How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your visitor.  BEATRICE Are you here to make fun of me too?  KAY No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we come in?  BEATRICE Sure. Lemonade?  CUT TO:  INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY  Beatrice speaks sitting on the couch.  BEATRICE The chief of police himself come up to the house and did a full-out professional investigation. Took a police report and writ down everything I said... from A to Z, not believing one thing I said. Sort of poking fun at me. And they said to me, ""If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?""  JAY sips some of her lemonade and winces, before spitting it back.  BEATRICE And I gotta admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.  Kay is nodding, while Jay checks out the room. He puts the glass on the table, and picks up a  framed PHOTO OF EDGAR  BEATRICE It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.  A GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay pokes Kay, shows him the picture with Edgar proudly holding his shotgun in the middle of the bog.  JAY Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.  BEATRICE I'm sorry.  KAY Go on.  BEATRICE Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.  KAY Did he say anything?  BEATRICE Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember.  KAY Sugar water.  Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Jay puts his as well.  BEATRICE Yeah, I remember that right. 'Cause I thought that was odd. That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or... regular water or... tap water.  Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes his glasses off, Jay follows.  KAY Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus --  JAY Wait a minute. You flash that thing, it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?  KAY Standard issue neuralyzer.  JAY That weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?  KAY All right. On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off.  JAY (butting in) Well, yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway. Okay. You know what? (points at Beatrice) You. Kicked. Him. Out. Alright? Now you're gonna do what he said, you're gonna go stay with your mother. Then you're gonna go get yourself some new dresses, some new shoes, maybe go somewhere where you can get a facial. (looks around the house) Oh, and I'd hire a decorator to come in here quick because, damn.  CUT TO:  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY  KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow.  JAY (from up outside the hole) Yo, Kay, check it out. When do I get my own flashy memory messer-upper thing?  KAY When you grow up.  Jay scratches his eyebrow with his middle finger. Kay returns to stare at the analyzer.  KAY Please -- not green.  Purple. And then green.  KAY (CONT'D) Damn.  Kay stands up.  KAY (CONT'D) I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?  JAY Uh, wait, that was on ""Final Jeopardy!"" last night. Damn, Alex said...  Kay snatches up a cellphone.  KAY Zed, we have a bug.  He turns off the radio and starts walking out the hole.  JAY So. What? We don't like bugs?  KAY Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species.  JAY You were stung as a child, right?  KAY Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?  JAY What's the move?  KAY With the bug in town, we watch the morgues.  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with ""City Morgue"" written across them. The words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.  COP Where do you want contestant number three?  The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.  LAUREL By the wall, I guess. (noticing) What's with the cat?  COP Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.  Laurel signs his clipboard.  LAUREL What's the problem with the cat?  COP Your problem.  Laurel gives him a dirty look as he leaves.  LAUREL I hate the living.  She goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.  LAUREL Shall we?  She wheels the stretcher under the lights.  INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY  The Arquilian is in an open drawer of the  cold chambers, while Laurel is hunched over Rosenberg's corpse. Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement.  LAUREL Oh, my God. Buddy, what are you?  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT  Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.  JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.  INT. MORGUE - NIGHT  In her darkened office, LAUREL is on her desk, recording her report.  LAUREL (into recorder) Subject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described  as...well...as really...  KAY (O.S.) Weird?  Kay turns on the lights.  KAY (cont'd) Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White.  LAUREL (checking her watch) You boys must not have much of a home life.  KAY We watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual?  LAUREL I'd say so -- triple homicide.  She gets up and takes them to the cold chambers.  LAUREL (CONT'D) The first corpse was perfectly normal, except that he was broken in half, but when I opened up the other two -- well, look.  She pulls back a drawer, revealing a body covered in a sheet.  LAUREL (CONT'D) There's a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything I've ever seen.  Pulling the sheet from the face reveals the Arquillian.  KAY I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?  LAUREL This way, Doctor.  Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on another gurney.  LAUREL (CONT'D) This one's even stranger. I did a full laparotomy. I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach -- though, if you want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal junction.  JAY I think, uh, we should start at the same place you did.  LAUREL All right.  She pulls out a glove box, hands Jay one and puts on the other. Rosenberg's cat steps on Jay's shoe.  JAY Your cat?  LAUREL Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies. Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't mind.  Jay is reluctant and retches, but puts his hand on the hole.  LAUREL (CONT'D) You have very pretty eyes.  JAY Thank you.  Laurel continues to guide him on the thick of the corpse.  LAUREL (CONT'D) Feel that? Where the piloric junction would be?  JAY Oh, yes. Exactly.  LAUREL Now push that aside. Notice anything strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?  JAY Nope. All fine.  LAUREL Doctor, they're all missing.  JAY (quickly) Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left. So they're intact, wherever they are. That we can be sure of.  LAUREL Have we met before? I have the strangest feeling of deja vu.  JAY Yeah, me too.  LAUREL Really? Okay. You wanna know what I really think? (re: Kay) But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's already under enough stress. (then) This body is not really a body, but it's actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether. The question is: what?  Jay just looks at her intrigued.  LAUREL Is this freaking you out?  JAY No, girl.  After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's staring at him.  Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.  LAUREL You know what I like to do sometimes? When it's really late?  JAY (intrigued) No...  As she starts talking...  KAY Doctor White...  Laurel just flips her hair as the chat is interrupted.  JAY (CONT'D) Excuse me.  She nods positively. He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian. But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.  KAY What do you think?  JAY (of Laurel) Very interesting.  She got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on.  KAY Of the body.  JAY Great body.  KAY The dead body?  JAY Man, you have to look at that thing.  LAUREL (O.S.) Dr. White.  KAY (pointing at the Arquillian) Recognize him?  JAY Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.  LAUREL (CONT'D) (louder) Dr. White.  KAY What do you think killed him?  JAY A bug?  Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name. Laurel enters the frame.  LAUREL (shouting) DR. WHITE!  Kay nudges Jay.  KAY You're up, Slugger.  Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.  LAUREL Look at this.  Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear.  JAY What the hell is that?  He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK --  -- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.  Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull.  A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.  Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.  The Tiny Little Green Man forces words out of his mouth.  ""ROSENBERG"" Must -- to pre -- prevent -- -- contest?  JAY It's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle?  LAUREL War?  The Green Man nods vigorously. That's it.  BALTIAN (faltering) Galaxy is on -- or -- or -- Orion's -- Be-Be... What is word?  JAY Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?  The Green man nods again, falls, and dies. The cat staring from above meows in sadness. Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other.  JAY (CONT'D) ""To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt?""  The hell does that mean? (turns around) Hey! Dr., uh, whatever, come here!  Kay begins over. Laurel looks at them.  LAUREL ""Doctor Whatever""? You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you?  Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.  KAY Rosenberg. Ah, damn. The Arquillians will not like this. He was one of the royal family.  Laurel smiles.  LAUREL I knew it. This is an alien. And you're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps...  Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.  JAY He said ""to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt.""  Kay puts on his glasses, Jay follows as Kay starts adjusting the neuralyzer.  LAUREL ... This make total sense. How else do you explain New York? The other night I'm in a cab, this guy...  FLASH! Kay blanks her out.  KAY ""Galaxy on Orion's Belt"" doesn't make sense.  JAY That's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said. Right after... (seeing the dazed Laurel) Damn, man, you did the flashy thing already.  LAUREL (as if awakening) Whoever you guys are,  you have to show ID if you're going to be in the morgue.  Kay puts on the glasses again.  KAY Of course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.  FLASH! He neuralyzes her again, Jay struggling to put the glasses quickly. Jay slaps his hand.  JAY Would you stop that?  KAY What?  JAY That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something!  KAY Never hurt her before. We have to close all the doors here. Special Services will be here any minute.  They start walking away.  JAY ""Never hurt her before""?! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!  KAY (evasive) Couple.  JAY Aren't you worried about, you know, long term damage?  KAY (more evasive) Little.  JAY Have you ever flashy-thinged me?  KAY Nah.  JAY I ain't playin' with ya! Have ya?  KAY No.  EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT  Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.  JAY I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.  KAY Not while I'm around, ace.  JAY You won't be happy till you fricassee someone's brain out.  An MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and two men dressed in black suits get out.  KAY (to an MIB Agent) We've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.  AGENT Yes, sir.  Jay stares at him.  KAY Make it a happy memory.  CUT TO:  INT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT  The Zap Em van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard.  Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.  He BELLOWS in rage and it finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, and wrenches the top off the box.  Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.  Edgar gets angry.  CUT TO:  EXT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT  The van shakes as Edgar wallows.  EDGAR WHERE IS IT?!  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR  As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING  Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast.  Kay is in a computer, slightly disheveled. On the screen, some sort of database search software. He types ""RESTON, ELIZABETH ANN"" on name, ""TRURO"". The image changes to a satellite view of North America, while the word ""SEARCHING"" blinks, encouraging patience. The printout changes to ""SUBJECT ACQUIRED."" It quickly zooms in on the Northeast.  Kay types some more. On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Massachusetts. As Kay types some more, Jay's voice is heard.  JAY (OS) Hey, Zed.  Jay appears holding a cup of coffee.  JAY Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here?  ZED The twins keep us on Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a psychotic episode.  The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION.  ZED Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky... (pointing) and here's Orion's belt --  He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.  JAY That's what the little guy was talking about, ""To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt...""  ZED There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars. You heard wrong.  JAY Look, whatever, I know what I heard.  Back to Kay, the computer zooms, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, the ""Elizabeth Ann Reston"", is tending to her garden. Whoever she is, she's lovely. Kay smiles as  Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight. He then types and the image freezes on her face. Jay is standing behind him.  JAY Pretty lady...  Kay clicks something, the software blackens and goes ""Subject Lost"". Jay drags a chair and sits down, sipping his coffee, as Kay rearranges his desk.  JAY (CONT'D) The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here. You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.  And, I take it, she never got those flowers.   KAY No.  JAY (CONT'D) So, what, she ever get married or anything?  KAY No.  Jay looks at him: ""Is this me in thirty years?"" Kay rolls his eyes.  JAY Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  KAY Try it.   ZED (O.S.) Kay.  Kay gets up, Jay follows, up to Zed in the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT.  Some lights are starting to go out.  ZED We've had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning.  JAY What do they know that we don't know?  Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.  KAY Why do rats desert the ship? (to the twins) Go to Lem Sat IV with a proton induction thermoscan, please.  ON THE SCREEN Earth changes to a green radar-like diagram.  KAY (CONT'D) Thank you. Okay, Lem Sat XVIII.  Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.  KAY (CONT'D) All right, four thousand.  Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture:  A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth.  KAY (CONT'D) That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.  ZEED And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.  A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender.  KAY Speak of the devil.  The communication continues.  KAY (CONT'D) They sound pissed.  The communication continues.  ZED (to the twins) Boys, translate that and step on it! (to Kay) Go to Rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up.  Kay and Jay walk away.  ZED (CONT'D) And Kay -- Give the kid a weapon.  Zed glances back to see the huge gun turrets on the Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below.  IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED SHOTGUN.  KAY Series four de-atomizer.  JAY I like that.  Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.  KAY (CONT'D) ""Noisy Cricket.""  JAY Kay, no, no, come on, man. You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a ""Midget Cricket?!""  Kay panics and pushes Jay's hand away as he almost points the gun at him.  JAY (CONT'D) (looks at the gun) I'm afraid I'm going to break it.  INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Out the window behind him, we can see the Zap-Em van, double parked in the street in front. SMASH! EDGAR smashes the revolving door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop. EDGAR steps inside.  All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.  Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it. It's Rosenberg a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to Rosenberg.  Edgar retches, as if got to some conclusion. From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in time to see the van lurch as a tow truck lifts its front wheels off the ground.  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.  EDGAR Hey, that's my truck!  DRIVER And make sure you tell them that at the impound.  Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.  DRIVER (CONT'D) Please...  He keeps hitching up the van. The MiB car parks nearby, JAY and KAY enter the ramsacked jewelry shop.  INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay furrows his brow.  JAY Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels?  KAY Someone who's not looking for jewels.  Jay moves behind the counter. On the wall there is an ornate locker full of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS, and several PHOTOS OF A CAT on the wall.  JAY This guy had a serious crush on his cat.  Jay's attention is broken by a gunshot. Outside, EDGAR, the farmer's rifle and the driver's shotgun, heads for the tow truck.  Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?  Jay points the Noisy Cricket at him and YELLS...  JAY Kay! GET DOWN!  And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar is driving down the street as Jay picks himself up, passing by a Kay that's lying down, covered in glass shards.  JAY Man! That's him. That's the bug! In the Edgar suit!  Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.  Kay runs out after Jay.  EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY  Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some garbage, while his SHOT...  Hits the rigging between the Zap-Em  Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly.  Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.  JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a parked car.  Kay appears and  yanks Jay out of the car.  KAY We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.  JAY Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't...  KAY There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it.  Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.  KAY Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.  After gesturing to the back of the Zap-Em van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.  KAY (into phone) Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY  Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over, and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.  ZED is in his office.  ZED Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.  Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor.  ZED You sorry little ingrates!  The worms dismiss Zed, and then start singing a melody similar to the ""Star-Spangled Banner"".  KAY (O.S.) What about the Arquillians?  ZED We've only translated a part of the message so far: ""Deliver the Galaxy.""  KAY (O.S.) No, they don't want much, do they?  ZED Oh, it gets better... They're holding us responsible.  He looks up at the screen. It reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY.  Cut to: EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY  The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.  EDGAR Where do you keep your dead?  VENDOR (thinks) I don't have any dead.  EDGAR Where?!  VENDOR I don't know, the city morgue!  Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked ""LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA."" Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out and picks up a color postcard.  He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off.  VENDOR That's three for a dollar, sir!  Cut to: EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)  As a crowd gathers around the Zap-Em Van, Jay tries using the standard cover-up...  JAY It was some light that refracted off of Venus... into some swamp gas... and that's what made the--  KAY (O.S.) All right, kid.  Jay starts walking towards Kay.  JAY Excuse me! What's up?  KAY (O.S.) The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means.  Jay and Kay are seen walking away from the wreckage, while the MIB clean-up van arrives.  KAY We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.  The crowd near gathers near the new vehicle as one agent in a shiny suit with his neuralyzer out shouts in a bullhorn.  CLEAN-UP AGENT May I have your attention? Thank you. If you'll gather over here. That's right, move in closer. That's good. If you look right here, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.  CUT TO:  EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY  Kay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR on the counter. He's wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.  Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.  JAY Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta be the worst disguise I've ever seen.  A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.  FRANK THE PUG You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.  Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG. Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.  KAY You busy, Frank?  FRANK THE PUG Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my ride's leaving in --  Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.  FRANK THE PUG Hey! Get your paws off me!  KAY Call the pound. We got a stray.  PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog. Jay tries to explain.  JAY The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.  KAY (to Frank) Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?  FRANK THE PUG I know nothing.  KAY Not a thing?  Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.  FRANK THE PUG Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of a galaxy. They thought he would be safe here on earth.  KAY And the bug had other plans.  FRANK THE PUG The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe. If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.  JAY Ask him about the belt.  KAY (to Frank) Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on ""Orion's belt."" What's he talking about, Frank?  FRANK THE PUG Beats me.  Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more.  JAY (to a person passing by) They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.  FRANK THE PUG The galaxy is here.  KAY Here?  JAY The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets? How's it here?  If a dog can smirk, Frank does.  FRANK THE PUG You humans, when're you gonna learn that size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small.  KAY How small?  FRANK THE PUG Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked before the flight.  Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.  KAY (to Frank the Pug) Get out of here. (then to Jay) The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.  Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk.  JAY Kay...  CUT TO:  INT. MORGUE - DAY  In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.  Laurel jumps.  LAUREL Boy, when you want attention --  She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light. Laurel turns the name tag to face her.  CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD ""ORION.""  As it is written across the collar of the cat.  LAUREL (O.S) ""Orion."" That's a pretty name.  From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.  Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a marble that has a glowing thing inside it.  LAUREL (CONT'D) What's this?  She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.  LAUREL Wow.  INT. ICON - DAY  It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield.  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  Edgar enters the morgue, shotgun in one hand. He gets to the bell on the countertop, BANGS it over and over. Orion hisses, and rushes inside the morgue. The morgue attendant, TONY, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter.  TONY Thank you for making sure the bell works.  Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.  TONY (CONT'D) (to Edgar) What's up, Farmer John?  EDGAR A man came in here earlier. A dead man.  TONY And this means what to me?  EDGAR He was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back.  TONY I'll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with --  WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth.  TONY (CONT'D) -- the deceased.  EDGAR Don't -- do that.  WHACK! Still another fly goes down.  TONY Do what?  EDGAR Don't -- do it.  Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.  TONY (CONT'D) Oh, man!  He ducks under the counter --  -- and comes up with two cans of bug spray. Edgar exhales an inhuman growl, and the terrified face of Tony is seen before we...  CUT TO:  EXT. MORGUE - DAY  Kay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.  JAY Look, Kay, let me handle this one.  KAY What?  JAY All we gotta do is get a cat. It's not really that hard. But if you go in, you'll lay your Jack Webb on her. Flash your brain ray all in her face. She'll wind up with leukemia. She's a doctor. She don't need you flashing away half her med school classes. Five minutes.  KAY Two minutes!  JAY OK.  And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR. He leans in, close, furious, the driver's pistol in one hand.  EDGAR Where is the animal?!  LAUREL I told you, I don't know!  Orion is running behind their backs.  EDGAR Let's see if we can find it.  He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue. Then  the BELL and a VOICE from the corridor outside.  JAY (O.S.) Hello? Anybody here?  Edgar stops.  The bell DINGS again.  JAY (O.S.) Hello?   INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  In the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He DINGS once more, then heads into the back.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  JAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring at Jay.  JAY Uh, hi.  LAUREL (oddly) Hello.  JAY (flashes a badge) I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth precinct. A cat came in here with a corpse the other day. ""Orion"" on the name tag.  LAUREL Yes. That's right.  JAY Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a witness in a murder case and I'm going to need to take it with me.  LAUREL I don't know where the cat is.  JAY You don't?  LAUREL No. (lowers her voice to a whisper) Maybe you could take me with you instead.  Jay looks at her.  JAY Damn, you do start fast, don't you?  LAUREL I'd really like to go with you. Now.  Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. Edgar is seen below the table, trying to see through the sheet, grabbing Laurel's ankle with one hand and clenching the gun with the other.  JAY And, uh, why exactly is that?  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. Waiting.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  Laurel seems to be going crazy. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go with what she's saying.  LAUREL I have something I need to show you.  She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist. Edgar does a heads up as if thinking ""Huh?"".  JAY Now slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that.  She leans in and lowers her voice.  LAUREL You don't understand. You really need to see this.  JAY I will, I will. One thing, I got to drive. It's not some macho trip. I'm saying that's the way I get down.  Edgar is rolling his eyes down the table.  LAUREL Look...  INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY  Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a SIZZLE, hit from a gob of goo.  Kay furrows his brow. Odd. He looks up, sharply.  Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.  INT. MORGUE - DAY  Laurel is at the end of her rope.  LAUREL Look, stud, I don't know how many more times I'm going to get to tell you this. There's something --  She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.  LAUREL (CONT'D) -- that you have to help me with.  Jay's smile vanishes as if he understands. Laurel nods positively, Edgar scoffs below. Jay reaches for the gun on his jacket.  ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on top of the examination table. Edgar snaps an arm up and grabs the cat, turning the table. Laurel screams.  Kay enters the morgue holding a pistol, gets right next to Jay already pointing the Noisy Cricket at Edgar, who holds the pistol under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.  KAY Freeze it, Bug!  Edgar is walking backwards holding Laurel.  LAUREL (to Jay) CHRIST, are you THICK!  JAY How was I supposed to know!?!  LAUREL What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!  JAY If you weren't coming on like--  LAUREL Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just --  EDGAR Everybody shut UP!  KAY Let her go, Shit Eater.  EDGAR Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!  KAY You're breakin' my heart. Show me your face and I'll cure all your ills.  EDGAR Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?  Edgar grabs Laurel's neck.  EDGAR (CONT'D) Would you care to see the fly get even?  KAY How far can you go with no ship? If that's what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.  EDGAR Put the weapons down!  KAY Never gonna happen, Insect.  The Galaxy is seen hanging from Edgar's gun hand. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him.  JAY It's okay, Laurel!  LAUREL HOW is it okay?!  JAY I mean it's going to be okay!  EDGAR Don't bet on it, meat sack.  And with that he turns, leaps --  -- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.  EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK  EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.  Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her mouth), races toward the nearby  Manhattan Street.  INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK  Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway.  They turn and run back.  EXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK  EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a halt inches from them.  INT. MORGUE - DUSK Jay and Kay  rush out of the morgue.  INT.  CAB - EXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door. He then pulls the wooden seat-beads, throws them atop the Cabbie, and pushes Laurel in before him, leaving her behind the wheel. He then tosses a crown that wason the car panel on the cabbie before taking the seat and closing the door.  Edgar shows Laurel the POSTCARDS  he took from the display on the newsstand.  EDGAR Take me here.  LAUREL What???  Edgar reveals two bug mandibles inside his mouth and SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.  Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward.  The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears around the corner.  CUT TO: INT. CAB - AFTERNOON  Edgar opens his mouth and swallows the icon, as Laurel stares in disbelief. He smiles.  CUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic.  CUT TO: OUTSIDE MORGUE A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads and crown.  JAY He's in a cab!  And Jay jumps down the rain and runs towards the street. Kay doesn't even change his expression as he walks the other way.  CUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK Jay is running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, and points his gun to one where there is a passenger in the front.  JAY Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!  -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.  PASSENGER Hey, man, what?  Up ahead the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. Kay stops the LTD right next to Jay.  KAY He's not leaving the planet in a cab. Let's go.  Jay enters through the back door. Kay drives away.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT  Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.  KAY (to tech at a desk) Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's not leaving the island.  KAY (CONT'D) What've we got from our friends upstairs?  ZED Same thing: ""Deliver the galaxy.""  KAY Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but we've got his ship. He's got to be looking for a way out.  Just then, a loud ALARM wails.  COMPUTER VOICE Warning. Protonic fusion detection.  AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking the North Pole.  Every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off.  JAY WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!  ZED Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond.  JAY A galactic standard week? How the hell long is that?  KAY One hour.  JAY One hour? Then what?  Kay seems to be holding laughter. Viewing the screen, it now reads: MIB DELIVER THE GALAXY OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED... SORRY  JAY (O.S.) That's bullshit.  The message now has a countdown that starts rolling from 1:00:00:00 in ""Earth Time Remaining""  KAY (O.S.) Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.  ZED (O.S.) And whatever planet it's on.  JAY You're talking about US!  ZED Sucks, doesn't it?  As Kay and Zed look through a map, Jay walks, deep in thought. Over him we hear:  KAY I'm getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.  ZED I already did. Frank took the last ship on the planet.  KAY Snedens Landing and Throg's Neck.  ZED They're gone.  KAY Atlantic City?  ZED Adios.  KAY Bayonne?  ZED Gone.  KAY There's Three Mile Island.  ZED Gone.  JAY Y'all.  KAY Staten Island?  ZED Gone, thank God.  JAY Fellas!  KAY We're running out of time. If the bug leaves with the galaxy--  JAY Hey. Old guys!  Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.  JAY (CONT'D) Do those still work?  They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by --  -- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --  DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her.  EDGAR You're coming with me.  LAUREL What?! Why?!  EDGAR It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.  And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.  It's shown a postcard on the passenger's seat featuring the World's Fair towers.  CUT TO:  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.  JAY Wait, the tunnel?!  KAY You know a better way to Queens?  JAY It's gonna be packed.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT  The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a few seconds, but then they round a bend --  -- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.  KAY Remember the little button?  JAY Yeah?!  KAY Push the red button.  Jay JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.  KAY (CONT'D) You may want to wear a seat belt.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT  As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the ""normal"" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons.  JAY Kay! Kay!  Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from underneath it. Jay is heard screaming as...  Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below.  It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel.  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.  KAY You're much too tense. You're a young man. You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.  Close on the car's 8-track player.  KAY (O.S.) You like music?  Kay puts on a tape labeled ""Elvis - Promised Land"", which instantly starts playing.  JAY Man!  KAY That's better.  Kay mouths along with the song, as Jay struggles to position himself on the ceiling.  EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. A ceiling panel is approaching...  JAY Kay! Kay!  Kay swerves the vehicle to dodge the arrow.   INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  JAY You do know Elvis is dead?  KAY No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.  And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --  INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT  -- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.  He cranks the wheel to the left.  EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT  Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --  -- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.  CUT TO:  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT  EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.  LAUREL You don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war.  EDGAR Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness.  LAUREL You're a wonderful father, but I'm staying here!  And with that she elbows him in the back of the head. Edgar reels, and tosses her in a nearby tree.  Laurel lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground.  Above, Edgar gestures as if ""goodbye"" and just keeps climbing. He eventually enters the flying saucer from a hatch below.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  The LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds.  AT THE TRUNK, KAY grab the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. He hands it to Jay.  JAY Now, that's what I'm talking about.  Kay gets a similar gun.  KAY Roaches check in.  He cocks the gun. Jay does the same.  JAY But they don't check out.  Kay walks away, to get a clear view, Jay follows.  INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT  The MIB staffers are in frenetic activity as the claxons still ring.  COMPUTER Warning: Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.  Zed watches the monitor reading exactly that. He finally starts to look worried.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  As if on cue, the saucer Edgar enter closes and begins to HUM. Lights ignite, and the ship begins to rise.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT  Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.  EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT  At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.  But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed.  All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops --  -- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciouly.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  Kay fiddles with the weapon he took from the trunk.  KAY We'll use pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --  JAY What?  Kay cocks the gun, points it at the sky.  KAY Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three.  Jay raises his weapon too.  KAY (CONT'D) One...two... three!  They pull their triggers. Jay takes a step back from the recoil As two enormous shock waves roll out from the barrel of the guns.  EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT  The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it HITS the ship --  -- which explodes. Hurtling back toward them.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  The saucer BREAKS through the flags near the Unisphere and then CRASHES through the enormous steel globe, and THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...  stopping just a few steps away from Jay and Kay, who just stood there watching the crash-land.  A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, more decomposed than ever walking slowly toward them, with contained fury.  EDGAR You idiots! You don't get it. I've won. It's over.You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a few seconds you won't even be matter!  KAY You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord.  KAY So hand over any galaxy you might be carrying and step away from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.  Edgar points up and smiles as he walks down the landing ramp.  EDGAR I'll put my hands on my head!  Edgar does that.  EDGAR Like this?  Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.  He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across.  Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug raises himself aloft on his legs.  He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally  Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a giant cockroach, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.  Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.  Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.  Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --  The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.  Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.  JAY That did not go at all like I had planned.  KAY Whatever happens, don't let him on the second ship.  JAY What are you talking about?  KAY Keep him on this planet.  JAY Kay, where are you going?  KAY Getting my gun back.  JAY What!?  Kay gets to his feet and starts walking after the Bug. Kay steps in front of the departing Bug and yells.  KAY (CONT'D) Hey, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?  The Bug stops. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien. The Bug's dripping fangs inches from Kay's face.  KAY You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! Eat me!  The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth. JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  JAY Kay! Kay!  The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. His mandibles push Kay down the Bug's throat.  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT  Laurel is watching in horror on the tree.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT THE BUG  STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.  INT. BUG - NIGHT  Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT  Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.  The concrete HITS the Bug's head -- it falls and gives an angry yelp.  JAY What's up?  Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.  JAY You just going to eat and run, huh? What about dessert?  The Bug kicks Jay with his second pair of limbs.  The hurled Jay falls near a burning tree branch. Dizzy, he starts to get up.  JAY That's it? Where you going?This party's just getting started.  He grabs the burning branch.  JAY Where're you going? Where you going?  Jay waves the flames in front of the bug, who dodges the branch.  JAY Listen. There's one way off this planet, baby, and that's through me.  The Bug punches Jay in the face. He falls on the ground, and narrowly misses being stepped on.  Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him.  He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when;  The Bug bends its head down between its legs.  Jay falls to the ground again.  The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.  In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, grabbing its tail, trying to drag it down. The Bug notes, and looks down. He shakes the tail until Jay is hurled away, sending him SAILING twenty feet through the air.  Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT  Laurel's branch breaks, she falls a small bit to the ground, near the burning branch. She promptly gets up.  EXT. WORLD'S FAIR -  NIGHT  The Bug continues to climb the tower, and in the distance, a battered Jay gets up. Despite struggling to talk, he continues to taunt the Bug. Laurel is watching him from behind a bush.  JAY Where're you going? Why you runnin', huh? I'm still standing. Come on.  Jay extends his arm at the creature.  JAY Bring it. Bring it.  He notices something on his arm...two cockroaches in his sleeve.  Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...  CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.  ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.  ON JAY. He smiles.  JAY I'm sorry. Was that your auntie?  ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.  Jay knows he's getting to him. He moves his foot over another roach.  JAY (CONT'D) That must mean that's your uncle, huh?  CRUNCH! He crushes another one.  JAY (CONT'D) You know you all look alike.  The Bug falls down from the steps and starts to walk towards Jay.  JAY Well, well. Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?  Jay keeps crunching roaches while the Bug gets near him . Laurel is still watching.  JAY What I can't understand is why you...  got to come down here bringing all this ruckus. Snatching up galaxies and everything. My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.  The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.  JAY You need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.  The triggering noise of the Deatomizer is heard.  JAY Too late.  Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.  The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end falls nearby; the head flying behind Jay.  Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers.  The other gun sails off into the darkness. Both spit the bug juice that fall on their mouths.  The Galaxy drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.  Jay calmly bends down and picks it up, as Kay pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number.  KAY Zed. Call the Arquillians. Tell 'em we have the galaxy.  ZED (O.S) You got it, friend.  Kay flips the phone closed.  JAY Going to get your gun back, huh?  KAY I like this gun.  As the two talk, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG is crawling in the background.  JAY While you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work. First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.              Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four. He kicked me. You know, it hurt. Then I got the fire. I was ''yah'' with the fire.  KAY Not bad for your second day of work, is it?  JAY This definitely rates about a  9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.  KAY Should've been here for the Zeronion migration in  1968. I guess you weren't even alive in '68.  HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. And just before the jaws snap down on their heads...  BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.  They turn to see...  LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking.  LAUREL Interesting job you guys got.  Jay spits the new bug goo that covered him.  CUT TO:  EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT  We see JAY and KAY walking towards the MIB HQ.  JAY Look, I know we got rules and everything, but... she did help us bust that bug. Maybe we don't have to flashy thing her.  Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.  JAY Come on. Who she gonna tell? She hang out with all dead people.  KAY It's not for her.It's for me.  JAY What?  KAY (looking up at the sky) They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.  JAY Kay, you're scaring your partner.  KAY I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.  JAY Wait a minute, Kay. I can't do this job by myself.  LAUREL (O.S.) Hey, guys.  Cut to Kay's LTD is parked nearby, LAUREL leaning her back against the car.  LAUREL My apartment isn't anywhere near here. It's not on the same island.  Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer, shows the dials to Jay.  KAY Days. Months. Years. Always face it forwards.  He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put his glasses on. Jay resists.  KAY I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach. That's one of a hundred memories I don't want.  Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.  KAY See you around, sport.  Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.  JAY No, you won't.  CUT TO:  EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY  CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY! Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel Mets' Centerfielder Says: ""UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"" MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA Returns to Girl He Left Behind  The last one has A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON, his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.  She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never gave her thirty years ago.  JAY, who's reading the paper, smiles.  AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE, (formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.  ELLE Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game.  It's apparent Jay has a new ""hip"" getup - oval-rim sunglasses, long Nehru jacket, and band collar without a necktie.  JAY Put in a call for Dennis Rodman, e's from that planet.  ELLE Rodman? You're kidding.  JAY Nope.  ELLE Not much of a disguise.  Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from the curb.  EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY  The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.  FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS  Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.  FROM THE STRATOSPHERE  The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land mass.  FROM THE EOSPHERE  North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.  FROM SPACE  Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.  FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY  Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.  FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY  The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals.  FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE  There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball --  -- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt.  An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it HITS another ball. The hand grabs both balls, and puts the marbles in a pouch, where they CLICK a dozen other big blue balls just like it.

nice guy With bad teeth got a nice ID for bad Beats I can't use ride fast their raps Slow I may make mistakes but everyone Has so I'm like MJ back when he had the Afro oh so I'm not black so maybe not But before everyone gets angry stop I'm That person they're people naturally Heymy blood all the people who keep on Going crazy off because I won't be Making amazing songs in a mainstream car A lot of prominent features I'm a Confident speaker with some dominant Teachers I deserve to be a starter but Constantly on the bleachers I'm awfully Smaller cheaper when I'm up on a spot And eager baby fearing this every time That they hear and it don't know that my Lyrics had a precision of building a Pyramid so when you live in this please Let me know when I'm standing here Frozen please let it go hit  metronome  Combine the compilation to unlock Superstardom and move all across the Nation but that it's just a dream and Probably a combination of a big ego and False encouragement on the way in but When I'm playing it just know it's all a Big game I'm just trying to blow up and Have a big name but when you think about It it is all insane working be created From chemicals in this brain but when You look at me a lack of respect when I'm cracking my neck so that I can rap To my chest cousin of bread some say That it's magic I step until I'm on the Same stage that you have it again but so When you think about the Hall of Fame You think about a people used to sit and Call your name and you check and wonder If it will be artists a step back into Reality it all remains damn alright I Just spilled water on my computer right Now on my computers breaking while I'm Doing this thirty thousand words shit Goddamn it My lyrics are not showing up on a swing You know when What I mean this is off the top I don't Need to use no machines hold up I know I Can freestyle but I can't do it forever But I am very clever okay Okay I'm gonna take a drink if you're Watching this take a drink - these are

even Get myself and you thinking you Understand you think I to be highly Screen gives you the upper hand please What I do is barely poetry this hope for Me I'm noticing people starting to Notice me but still consider me Confidence then consider me ready and Giving out all my flawlessness bye Honestly all of this is haunting me Probably it is just a sense of myself Wobble and toppling into awfully small Pieces normally all leaving is tragic And knobs leading it follows me all Evening it's calling my name it Constantly makes it so hard to stay away I close my eyes I let it go and it all Fades away yeah we're just trying to Find a great escape to get away from how We live in life day to day some people Fight it in a drink or in a cup or in Some bling or branded drug or any things That

212,Taras Bulba ,https://genius.com/albums/Nikolai-gogol/Taras-bulba,The Dirty Heads,[],"At the time when these things took place, there were as yet on the frontiers neither custom-house officials nor guards—those bugbears of enterprising people—so that any one could bring across anything he fancied. If any one made a search or inspection, he did it chiefly for his own pleasure, especially if there happened to be in the waggon objects attractive to his eye, and if his own hand possessed a certain weight and power. But the bricks found no admirers, and they entered the principal gate unmolested. Bulba, in his narrow cage, could only hear the noise, the shouts of the driver, and nothing more. Yankel, bouncing up and down on his dust-covered nag, turned, after making several detours, into a dark, narrow street bearing the names of the Muddy and also of the Jews' street, because Jews from nearly every part of Warsaw were to be found here. This street greatly resembled a back-yard turned wrong side out. The sun never seemed to shine into it. The black wooden houses, with numerous poles projecting from the windows, still further increased the darkness. Rarely did a brick wall gleam red among them; for these too, in many places, had turned quite black. Here and there, high up, a bit of stuccoed wall illumined by the sun glistened with intolerable whiteness. Pipes, rags, shells, broken and discarded tubs: every one flung whatever was useless to him into the street, thus affording the passer-by an opportunity of exercising all his five senses with the rubbish. A man on horseback could almost touch with his hand the poles thrown across the street from one house to another, upon which hung Jewish stockings, short trousers, and smoked geese. Sometimes a pretty little Hebrew face, adorned with discoloured pearls, peeped out of an old window. A group of little Jews, with torn and dirty garments and curly hair, screamed and rolled about in the dirt. A red-haired Jew, with freckles all over his face which made him look like a sparrow's egg, gazed from a window. He addressed Yankel at once in his gibberish, and Yankel at once drove into a court-yard. Another Jew came along, halted, and entered into conversation. When Bulba finally emerged from beneath the bricks, he beheld three Jews talking with great warmth.  Yankel turned to him and said that everything possible would be done; that his Ostap was in the city jail, and that although it would be difficult to persuade the jailer, yet he hoped to arrange a meeting.  Bulba entered the room with the three Jews.  The Jews again began to talk among themselves in their incomprehensible tongue. Taras looked hard at each of them. Something seemed to have moved him deeply; over his rough and stolid countenance a flame of hope spread, of hope such as sometimes visits a man in the last depths of his despair; his aged heart began to beat violently as though he had been a youth.  ""Listen, Jews!"" said he, and there was a triumphant ring in his words. ""You can do anything in the world, even extract things from the bottom of the sea; and it has long been a proverb, that a Jew will steal from himself if he takes a fancy to steal. Set my Ostap at liberty! give him a chance to escape from their diabolical hands. I promised this man five thousand ducats; I will add another five thousand: all that I have, rich cups, buried gold, houses, all, even to my last garment, I will part with; and I will enter into a contract with you for my whole life, to give you half of all the booty I may gain in war.""  ""Oh, impossible, dear lord, it is impossible!"" said Yankel with a sigh.  ""Impossible,"" said another Jew.  All three Jews looked at each other.  ""We might try,"" said the third, glancing timidly at the other two. ""God may favour us.""  All three Jews discussed the matter in German. Bulba, in spite of his straining ears, could make nothing of it; he only caught the word ""Mardokhai"" often repeated.  ""Listen, my lord!"" said Yankel. ""We must consult with a man such as there never was before in the world... ugh, ugh! as wise as Solomon; and if he will do nothing, then no one in the world can. Sit here: this is the key; admit no one."" The Jews went out into the street.  Taras locked the door, and looked out from the little window upon the dirty Jewish street. The three Jews halted in the middle of the street and began to talk with a good deal of warmth: a fourth soon joined them, and finally a fifth. Again he heard repeated, ""Mardokhai, Mardokhai!"" The Jews glanced incessantly towards one side of the street; at length from a dirty house near the end of it emerged a foot in a Jewish shoe and the skirts of a caftan. ""Ah! Mardokhai, Mardokhai!"" shouted the Jews in one voice. A thin Jew somewhat shorter than Yankel, but even more wrinkled, and with a huge upper lip, approached the impatient group; and all the Jews made haste to talk to him, interrupting each other. During the recital, Mardokhai glanced several times towards the little window, and Taras divined that the conversation concerned him.  Mardokhai waved his hands, listened, interrupted, spat frequently to one side, and, pulling up the skirts of his caftan, thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out some jingling thing, showing very dirty trousers in the operation. Finally all the Jews set up such a shouting that the Jew who was standing guard was forced to make a signal for silence, and Taras began to fear for his safety; but when he remembered that Jews can only consult in the street, and that the demon himself cannot understand their language, he regained his composure.  Two minutes later the Jews all entered the room together. Mardokhai approached Taras, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, ""When we set to work it will be all right."" Taras looked at this Solomon whom the world had never known and conceived some hope: indeed, his face might well inspire confidence. His upper lip was simply an object of horror; its thickness being doubtless increased by adventitious circumstances. This Solomon's beard consisted only of about fifteen hairs, and they were on the left side. Solomon's face bore so many scars of battle, received for his daring, that he had doubtless lost count of them long before, and had grown accustomed to consider them as birthmarks.  Mardokhai departed, accompanied by his comrades, who were filled with admiration at his wisdom. Bulba remained alone. He was in a strange, unaccustomed situation for the first time in his life; he felt uneasy. His mind was in a state of fever. He was no longer unbending, immovable, strong as an oak, as he had formerly been: but felt timid and weak. He trembled at every sound, at every fresh Jewish face which showed itself at the end of the street. In this condition he passed the whole day. He neither ate nor drank, and his eye never for a moment left the small window looking on the street. Finally, late at night, Mardokhai and Yankel made their appearance. Taras's heart died within him.  ""What news? have you been successful?"" he asked with the impatience of a wild horse.  But before the Jews had recovered breath to answer, Taras perceived that Mardokhai no longer had the locks, which had formerly fallen in greasy curls from under his felt cap. It was evident that he wished to say something, but he uttered only nonsense which Taras could make nothing of. Yankel himself put his hand very often to his mouth as though suffering from a cold.  ""Oh, dearest lord!"" said Yankel: ""it is quite impossible now! by heaven, impossible! Such vile people that they deserve to be spit upon! Mardokhai here says the same. Mardokhai has done what no man in the world ever did, but God did not will that it should be so. Three thousand soldiers are in garrison here, and to-morrow the prisoners are all to be executed.""  Taras looked the Jew straight in the face, but no longer with impatience or anger.  ""But if my lord wishes to see his son, then it must be early to-morrow morning, before the sun has risen. The sentinels have consented, and one gaoler has promised. But may he have no happiness in the world, woe is me! What greedy people! There are none such among us: I gave fifty ducats to each sentinel and to the gaoler.""  ""Good. Take me to him!"" exclaimed Taras, with decision, and with all his firmness of mind restored. He agreed to Yankel's proposition that he should disguise himself as a foreign count, just arrived from Germany, for which purpose the prudent Jew had already provided a costume. It was already night. The master of the house, the red-haired Jew with freckles, pulled out a mattress covered with some kind of rug, and spread it on a bench for Bulba. Yankel lay upon the floor on a similar mattress. The red-haired Jew drank a small cup of brandy, took off his caftan, and betook himself—looking, in his shoes and stockings, very like a lean chicken—with his wife, to something resembling a cupboard. Two little Jews lay down on the floor beside the cupboard, like a couple of dogs. But Taras did not sleep; he sat motionless, drumming on the table with his fingers. He kept his pipe in his mouth, and puffed out smoke, which made the Jew sneeze in his sleep and pull his coverlet over his nose. Scarcely was the sky touched with the first faint gleams of dawn than he pushed Yankel with his foot, saying: ""Rise, Jew, and give me your count's dress!""  In a moment he was dressed. He blackened his moustache and eyebrows, put on his head a small dark cap; even the Cossacks who knew him best would not have recognised him. Apparently he was not more than thirty-five. A healthy colour glowed on his cheeks, and his scars lent him an air of command. The gold-embroidered dress became him extremely well.  The streets were still asleep. Not a single one of the market folk as yet showed himself in the city, with his basket on his arm. Yankel and Bulba made their way to a building which presented the appearance of a crouching stork. It was large, low, wide, and black; and on one side a long slender tower like a stork's neck projected above the roof. This building served for a variety of purposes; it was a barrack, a jail, and the criminal court. The visitors entered the gate and found themselves in a vast room, or covered courtyard. About a thousand men were sleeping here. Straight before them was a small door, in front of which sat two sentries playing at some game which consisted in one striking the palm of the other's hand with two fingers. They paid little heed to the new arrivals, and only turned their heads when Yankel said, ""It is we, sirs; do you hear? it is we.""  ""Go in!"" said one of them, opening the door with one hand, and holding out the other to his comrade to receive his blows.  They entered a low and dark corridor, which led them to a similar room with small windows overhead. ""Who goes there?"" shouted several voices, and Taras beheld a number of warriors in full armour. ""We have been ordered to admit no one.""  ""It is we!"" cried Yankel; ""we, by heavens, noble sirs!"" But no one would listen to him. Fortunately, at that moment a fat man came up, who appeared to be a commanding officer, for he swore louder than all the others.  ""My lord, it is we! you know us, and the lord count will thank you.""  ""Admit them, a hundred fiends, and mother of fiends! Admit no one else. And no one is to draw his sword, nor quarrel.""  The conclusion of this order the visitors did not hear. ""It is we, it is I, it is your friends!"" Yankel said to every one they met.  ""Well, can it be managed now?"" he inquired of one of the guards, when they at length reached the end of the corridor.  ""It is possible, but I don't know whether you will be able to gain admission to the prison itself. Yana is not here now; another man is keeping watch in his place,"" replied the guard.  ""Ai, ai!"" cried the Jew softly: ""this is bad, my dear lord!""  ""Go on!"" said Taras, firmly, and the Jew obeyed.  At the arched entrance of the vaults stood a heyduke, with a moustache trimmed in three layers: the upper layer was trained backwards, the second straight forward, and the third downwards, which made him greatly resemble a cat.  The Jew shrank into nothing and approached him almost sideways: ""Your high excellency! High and illustrious lord!""  ""Are you speaking to me, Jew?""  ""To you, illustrious lord.""  ""Hm, but I am merely a heyduke,"" said the merry-eyed man with the triple-tiered moustache.  ""And I thought it was the Waiwode himself, by heavens! Ai, ai, ai!"" Thereupon the Jew twisted his head about and spread out his fingers. ""Ai, what a fine figure! Another finger's-breadth and he would be a colonel. The lord no doubt rides a horse as fleet as the wind and commands the troops!""  The heyduke twirled the lower tier of his moustache, and his eyes beamed.  ""What a warlike people!"" continued the Jew. ""Ah, woe is me, what a fine race! Golden cords and trappings that shine like the sun; and the maidens, wherever they see warriors—Ai, ai!"" Again the Jew wagged his head.  The heyduke twirled his upper moustache and uttered a sound somewhat resembling the neighing of a horse.  ""I pray my lord to do us a service!"" exclaimed the Jew: ""this prince has come hither from a foreign land, and wants to get a look at the Cossacks. He never, in all his life, has seen what sort of people the Cossacks are.""  The advent of foreign counts and barons was common enough in Poland: they were often drawn thither by curiosity to view this half-Asiatic corner of Europe. They regarded Moscow and the Ukraine as situated in Asia. So the heyduke bowed low, and thought fit to add a few words of his own.  ""I do not know, your excellency,"" said he, ""why you should desire to see them. They are dogs, not men; and their faith is such as no one respects.""  ""You lie, you son of Satan!"" exclaimed Bulba. ""You are a dog yourself! How dare you say that our faith is not respected? It is your heretical faith which is not respected.""  ""Oho!"" said the heyduke. ""I can guess who you are, my friend; you are one of the breed of those under my charge. So just wait while I summon our men.""  Taras realised his indiscretion, but vexation and obstinacy hindered him from devising a means of remedying it. Fortunately Yankel managed to interpose at this moment:—  ""Most noble lord, how is it possible that the count can be a Cossack? If he were a Cossack, where could have he obtained such a dress, and such a count-like mien?""  ""Explain that yourself."" And the heyduke opened his wide mouth to shout.  ""Your royal highness, silence, silence, for heaven's sake!"" cried Yankel. ""Silence! we will pay you for it in a way you never dreamed of: we will give you two golden ducats.""  ""Oho! two ducats! I can't do anything with two ducats. I give my barber two ducats for only shaving the half of my beard. Give me a hundred ducats, Jew."" Here the heyduke twirled his upper moustache. ""If you don't, I will shout at once.""  ""Why so much?"" said the Jew, sadly, turning pale, and undoing his leather purse; but it was lucky that he had no more in it, and that the heyduke could not count over a hundred.  ""My lord, my lord, let us depart quickly! Look at the evil-minded fellow!"" said Yankel to Taras, perceiving that the heyduke was turning the money over in his hand as though regretting that he had not demanded more.  ""What do you mean, you devil of a heyduke?"" said Bulba. ""What do you mean by taking our money and not letting us see the Cossacks? No, you must let us see them. Since you have taken the money, you have no right to refuse.""  ""Go, go to the devil! If you won't, I'll give the alarm this moment. Take yourselves off quickly, I say!""  ""My lord, my lord, let us go! in God's name let us go! Curse him! May he dream such things that he will have to spit,"" cried poor Yankel.  Bulba turned slowly, with drooping head, and retraced his steps, followed by the complaints of Yankel who was sorrowing at the thought of the wasted ducats.  ""Why be angry? Let the dog curse. That race cannot help cursing. Oh, woe is me, what luck God sends to some people! A hundred ducats merely for driving us off! And our brother: they have torn off his ear-locks, and they made wounds on his face that you cannot bear to look at, and yet no one will give him a hundred gold pieces. O heavens! Merciful God!""  But this failure made a much deeper impression on Bulba, expressed by a devouring flame in his eyes.  ""Let us go,"" he said, suddenly, as if arousing himself; ""let us go to the square. I want to see how they will torture him.""  ""Oh, my lord! why go? That will do us no good now.""  ""Let us go,"" said Bulba, obstinately; and the Jew followed him, sighing like a nurse.  The square on which the execution was to take place was not hard to find: for the people were thronging thither from all quarters. In that savage age such a thing constituted one of the most noteworthy spectacles, not only for the common people, but among the higher classes. A number of the most pious old men, a throng of young girls, and the most cowardly women, who dreamed the whole night afterwards of their bloody corpses, and shrieked as loudly in their sleep as a drunken hussar, missed, nevertheless, no opportunity of gratifying their curiosity. ""Ah, what tortures!"" many of them would cry, hysterically, covering their eyes and turning away; but they stood their ground for a good while, all the same. Many a one, with gaping mouth and outstretched hands, would have liked to jump upon other folk's heads, to get a better view. Above the crowd towered a bulky butcher, admiring the whole process with the air of a connoisseur, and exchanging brief remarks with a gunsmith, whom he addressed as ""Gossip,"" because he got drunk in the same alehouse with him on holidays. Some entered into warm discussions, others even laid wagers. But the majority were of the species who, all the world over, look on at the world and at everything that goes on in it and merely scratch their noses. In the front ranks, close to the bearded civic-guards, stood a young noble, in warlike array, who had certainly put his whole wardrobe on his back, leaving only his torn shirt and old shoes at his quarters. Two chains, one above the other, hung around his neck. He stood beside his mistress, Usisya, and glanced about incessantly to see that no one soiled her silk gown. He explained everything to her so perfectly that no one could have added a word. ""All these people whom you see, my dear Usisya,"" he said, ""have come to see the criminals executed; and that man, my love, yonder, holding the axe and other instruments in his hands, is the executioner, who will despatch them. When he begins to break them on the wheel, and torture them in other ways, the criminals will still be alive; but when he cuts off their heads, then, my love, they will die at once. Before that, they will cry and move; but as soon as their heads are cut off, it will be impossible for them to cry, or to eat or drink, because, my dear, they will no longer have any head."" Usisya listened to all this with terror and curiosity.  The upper stories of the houses were filled with people. From the windows in the roof peered strange faces with beards and something resembling caps. Upon the balconies, beneath shady awnings, sat the aristocracy. The hands of smiling young ladies, brilliant as white sugar, rested on the railings. Portly nobles looked on with dignity. Servants in rich garb, with flowing sleeves, handed round various refreshments. Sometimes a black-eyed young rogue would take her cake or fruit and fling it among the crowd with her own noble little hand. The crowd of hungry gentles held up their caps to receive it; and some tall noble, whose head rose amid the throng, with his faded red jacket and discoloured gold braid, and who was the first to catch it with the aid of his long arms, would kiss his booty, press it to his heart, and finally put it in his mouth. The hawk, suspended beneath the balcony in a golden cage, was also a spectator; with beak inclined to one side, and with one foot raised, he, too, watched the people attentively. But suddenly a murmur ran through the crowd, and a rumour spread, ""They are coming! they are coming! the Cossacks!""  They were bare-headed, with their long locks floating in the air. Their beards had grown, and their once handsome garments were worn out, and hung about them in tatters. They walked neither timidly nor surlily, but with a certain pride, neither looking at nor bowing to the people. At the head of all came Ostap.  What were old Taras's feelings when thus he beheld his Ostap? What filled his heart then? He gazed at him from amid the crowd, and lost not a single movement of his. They reached the place of execution. Ostap stopped. He was to be the first to drink the bitter cup. He glanced at his comrades, raised his hand, and said in a loud voice: ""God grant that none of the heretics who stand here may hear, the unclean dogs, how Christians suffer! Let none of us utter a single word."" After this he ascended the scaffold.  ""Well done, son! well done!"" said Bulba, softly, and bent his grey head.  The executioner tore off his old rags; they fastened his hands and feet in stocks prepared expressly, and—We will not pain the reader with a picture of the hellish tortures which would make his hair rise upright on his head. They were the outcome of that coarse, wild age, when men still led a life of warfare which hardened their souls until no sense of humanity was left in them. In vain did some, not many, in that age make a stand against such terrible measures. In vain did the king and many nobles, enlightened in mind and spirit, demonstrate that such severity of punishment could but fan the flame of vengeance in the Cossack nation. But the power of the king, and the opinion of the wise, was as nothing before the savage will of the magnates of the kingdom, who, by their thoughtlessness and unconquerable lack of all far-sighted policy, their childish self-love and miserable pride, converted the Diet into the mockery of a government. Ostap endured the torture like a giant. Not a cry, not a groan, was heard. Even when they began to break the bones in his hands and feet, when, amid the death-like stillness of the crowd, the horrible cracking was audible to the most distant spectators; when even his tormentors turned aside their eyes, nothing like a groan escaped his lips, nor did his face quiver. Taras stood in the crowd with bowed head; and, raising his eyes proudly at that moment, he said, approvingly, ""Well done, boy! well done!""  But when they took him to the last deadly tortures, it seemed as though his strength were failing. He cast his eyes around.  O God! all strangers, all unknown faces! If only some of his relatives had been present at his death! He would not have cared to hear the sobs and anguish of his poor, weak mother, nor the unreasoning cries of a wife, tearing her hair and beating her white breast; but he would have liked to see a strong man who might refresh him with a word of wisdom, and cheer his end. And his strength failed him, and he cried in the weakness of his soul, ""Father! where are you? do you hear?""  ""I hear!"" rang through the universal silence, and those thousands of people shuddered in concert. A detachment of cavalry hastened to search through the throng of people. Yankel turned pale as death, and when the horsemen had got within a short distance of him, turned round in terror to look for Taras; but Taras was no longer beside him; every trace of him was lost.",[],63,,Spread Too Thin,https://genius.com/Nikolai-gogol-taras-bulba-chap-11-annotated,[],2012.0

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!  AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  DUKE (V/O) ... and a voice was screaming: Holy Jesus!  What are these goddamn animals?  CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -  DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere. GONZO casually looks over...  GONZO What are you yelling about?  DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.  DUKE Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.  DUKE (V/O) No point mentioning these bats.  I thought.  The poor bastard will see them soon enough.  DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats, frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles through the impressive stash.  DUKE (V/O) We had two bags of grass, seventy- five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.  3.   DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives back into the car.  DUKE (V/O) Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.  THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground, weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A BAT?  EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY  IN THE RED SHARK  GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a lousy driver.  DUKE (V/O) The only thing that really worried me was the ether.  There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.  The radio news wars with ""SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL"" on a tape recorder.  RADIO NEWS An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week...  GONZO changes the station - ""ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE"" vies with ""SYMPATHY""... He sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer. The RED SHARK fishtails.  GONZO ""One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.""  4.   DUKE (muttering to himself) One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait till you see those goddamn bats.  UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD  A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down the road...  GONZO Let's give that boy a lift.  GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side of the road.  DUKE We can't stop here - this is bat country!  GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.  HITCHHIKER Hot damn!  I never rode in a convertible before!  Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER- NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.  DUKE Is that right?  Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?  The HITCHHIKER hesitates.  GONZO We're your friends.  We're not like the others.  DUKE (hissing sharply) No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.  DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.  EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY  The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED SHARK screams down the road.  5.   GONZO sings along to the tape player.  The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out and taking his chances.  DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear view mirror.  DUKE (V/O) How long could we maintain, I wondered.  How long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy?  What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family.  The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling down GONZO's neck.  DUKE (V/O) Would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?  DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with the words, sometimes not.  DUKE (V/O) If so - well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.  Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...  DUKE (out loud to himself) Jesus!  Did I say that?  DUKE (V/O) Or just think it?  Was I talking? Did they hear me?  GONZO (reassuringly to HITCHHIKER) It's okay.  He's admiring the shape of your skull.  DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER giggles nervously.  6.   DUKE (V/O) Maybe I better have a chat with this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I explain things, he'll rest easy...  DUKE (roaring over the road noise) THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --  The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.  DUKE (yells) CAN YOU HEAR ME?  The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs into the back seat.  DUKE That's good.  Because I want you to have all the background.  This is a very ominous assignment -- with overtones of extreme personal danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit!  This is a true story!... (WHACKS the BACK OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT with his fist)   The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.  GONZO (screams) Keep your hands off my fucking neck!  The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS HIM BACK DOWN.  DUKE (V/O) Our vibrations were getting nasty -- but why?  Was there no communication in this car?  Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?  The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.  7.   DUKE (to HITCHHIKER) I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I think he's probably Samoan.  But it doesn't matter, does it?  Are you prejudiced?  HITCHHIKER Hell, no!  DUKE I didn't think so.  Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I forgot all about this beer.  You want one? (HITCHHIKER shakes his head) How about some ether?  HITCHHIKER What?  DUKE Never mind.  Let's get right to the heart of this thing.  Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...  INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY  A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.  DUKE (V/O) ... in the patio section, of course, drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971.  The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious conversation.  8.   DUKE I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated.  The weasels have started closing in.  The DWARF sneers.  DWARF Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir...  DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...  DUKE Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...  DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A MOVIE SPY.  DWARF That was headquarters.  They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda.  He'll have the details.  All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out.  GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!  GONZO God hell!  I think I see the pattern!  This one sounds like real trouble!  You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over.  As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine.  And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... (GONZO tucks his khaki undershirt into his white bellbottoms -- he means business!) This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.  9.   DUKE Why not?  If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.  DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them with the (very large) check in his hand.  They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.  DUKE I tell you, my man.  This is the American Dream in action!  We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.  GONZO Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind of story is this?  EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY  DUKE and GONZO emerge.  DUKE The Mint 400!  The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized sport! (handing parking ticket to Valet) -- a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas... at least that's what the press release says.  Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They jump in.  DUKE We're going to have to drum it up on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.  And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose- bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.  EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY  The PINTO races through shot.  DUKE (V/O) Getting hold of the drugs and shirts had been no problem...  10.   EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY  The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back window full of Hawaiian shirts.  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) ... but the car and tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood.  INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY  TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four Singapore Slings.  GONZO O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes. (to DUKE -- hand over the PHONE) I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring. (into PHONE) What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card!  Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?  DUKE Don't take any guff from these swine. (GONZO slams the phone down) Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment.  Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.  GONZO We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.  DUKE We will.  You Samoans are all the same.  You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.  11.   EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK  The PINTO races down street.  DUKE (V/O) The store was closed, but the salesman said he would wait, if we hurried...  EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK  They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.  DUKE (V/O) But we were delayed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrain.  Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.  EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT  DUKE (V/O) We had trouble, again, at the car rental agency.  Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.  AGENT Say... uh... you fellas are going to be careful with this car, aren't you?  DUKE Of course.  DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.  AGENT Well, good god!  You just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didn't even slow down! Forty-five in reverse!  And you barely missed the pump!  DUKE No harm done.  I always test the transmission that way.  The rear end.  For stress factors.  12.   GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.  AGENT Say.  Are you fellows drinking?  DUKE Not me.  We're responsible people.  He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.  GONZO There's another worrier.  He's probably all cranked up on speed.  EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT  STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.  DUKE (V/O) We spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car.  Then we ate some mescaline and went swimming.  The surf crashes in the distance...  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT  DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself float up through the silvery bubbles...  DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING MOONLIT SURF.  DUKE (V/O) Our trip was different.  It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country.  But only for those with true grit...  EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY  DUKE's intense face.  DUKE ...and we're chock full of that!  13.   GONZO Damn right!  DUKE My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!  The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.  DUKE (V/O) He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't.  He was lying to me.  GONZO My heart!  GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.  GONZO (CONT'D) Where's the medicine?  DUKE The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.  DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.  DUKE Don't worry, this man has a bad heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we have a cure for it.  DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The HITCHHIKER looks petrified.  GONZO (suddenly flailing his naked arms at the sky) Turn up the fucking music!  My heart feels like an alligator! Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must have bass!  What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?  DUKE (turns up music to full volume) You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch your language!  You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!  14.   GONZO (laughing uncontrollably) What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police!  We need help!  DUKE (to HITCHHIKER) Pay no attention to this swine.  He can't handle the medicine. (he begins laughing)   GONZO (to the HITCHHIKER) The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.  I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?  GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.  GONZO (CONT'D) Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!  DUKE And eat them!  That bastard won't get away with this!  What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?  GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.  The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID, AND FLEES.  HITCHHIKER Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot. I like you guys.  Don't worry about me.  DUKE (yells) Wait a minute!  Come back and have a beer!  The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.  15.   GONZO Good riddance.  That boy made me nervous.  Did you see his eyes? (laughing) Jesus, this is good medicine.  DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.  DUKE (suddenly clambering into the front seat) Move over!!  We have to get out of California before that kid finds a cop!  DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...  EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY  THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead driving.  DUKE (V/O) It was absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint Hotel before the deadline for press registration. Otherwise, we might have to pay for our suite.  GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off and the powder swirls away on the wind.  GONZO Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god just did to us?  DUKE God didn't do that!  You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!  GONZO (waving his .357 Magnum at Duke) You better be careful.  Plenty of vultures out here.  They'll pick your bones clean before morning.  DUKE You whore!  GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.  16.   GONZO Here -- chew this.  It's your half of the acid.  DUKE takes his half -- chews it.  DUKE How long do I have?  GONZO Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed.  It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal.  Are you ready for that?  Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.  DUKE (V/O) Thirty minutes.  It was going to be very close.  The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard: ""DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20 YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!""  EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK  The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner spanning the street announces the MINT 400.  DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.  DUKE I need this, right?  ATTENDANT I'll remember your face.  DUKE stares -- losing it...  DUKE (V/O) There is no way of explaining the terror I felt.  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY  DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to queue jump and failing.  17.   DUKE (V/O) I was pouring sweat.  My blood is too thick for Nevada.  I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate.  A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) Be quiet, be calm... name, rank, and press affiliation, nothing else...  DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING AROUND -- absolutely no success.  Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) ...ignore this terrible drug, pretend it's not happening...  The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND EXPLODES!  DUKE HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT? I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I REALIZE OF COURSE...  As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH. He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.  DUKE ... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE. YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?  DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.  18.   RESERVATIONS CLERK (hands him an envelope) Your suite's not ready yet.  But there's somebody looking for you.  Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...  DUKE (shouts) NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET!  The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS. DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.  GONZO I can handle this.  This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once.  We'll be in the bar.  GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green jowls and fangs.  INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY  The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme. DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...  GONZO (to the bartender) Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. (opens the envelope) Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?  DUKE Lacerda?  DUKE (V/O) I couldn't remember.  The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us...  DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.  19.   DUKE Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive.  It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all...  DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.  DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.  DUKE (V/O) I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things!  It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!  GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.  GONZO If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.  GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying... as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to keep him in his line of vision.  GONZO I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.  I told him I knew what he was up to... (GONZO rallies -- turns fierce) He says he's a photographer!  But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!  He knows we're onto him!  DUKE But what about our room?  And the golf shoes?  A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.  DUKE (CONT'D) (grabbing GONZO trying to hold him still) Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over there!  They've spotted us!  20.   Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality. GONZO is sitting in his original position.  GONZO (downs his drink -- gets up) That's the press table.  Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with.  You handle that, and I'll check on the room.  DUKE No, no.  Don't leave me!  Black screen.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK  A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK, protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on the floor next to DUKE.  BELL BOY Four club sandwiches, four shrimp cocktails.  DUKE There's a big... machine in the sky... some kind of electric snake...  DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million colored lights.  BELL BOY ... a quart of rum...  DUKE ... coming straight at us.  GONZO Shoot it.  DUKE Not yet.  I want to study its habits.  BELL BOY ... and nine fresh grapefruit.  21.   GONZO Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can get.  GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into DUKE.  GONZO Look, you've got to stop this talk about snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff.  It's making me sick!  DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...  On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.  Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT CALLEY court-martial.  DUKE What are you talking about?  GONZO You bastard!  They'll never let us back in that place.  I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles!  You scared the shit out of those people!  They were ready to call the cops.  Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...  A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.  DUKE Oh my God!  Who's that?!  GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep suspicion.  LACERDA Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer. Got your press passes?  Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in.  My, what a sight!  DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.  22.   Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.  DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised, filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him -- talking a foreign language.  LACERDA Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis. Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs. Couple of Triumphs, here and there a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race it's gonna be.  DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is now just a keen photographer.L  LACERDA Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good night's sleep.  I know I will.  And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.  DUKE (weakly) That's good...  GONZO I think he's lying to us.  I could see it in his eyes.  DUKE (even weaker) They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.  DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...  GONZO Turn that shit off!  GONZO kills the TV.  Black screen.  DUKE (V/O) Never lose sight of the primary responsibility.  Cover the story. But what was the story?  Nobody had bothered to say.  23.   EXT. DESERT - DAWN  Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint Gun Club.  Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400 RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights, topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.  DUKE wanders through.  DUKE (V/O) The racers were ready at dawn. Very tense.  But the race didn't start until nine so we had three long hours to kill.  A sign by a long trestle table: ""KOFFEE & DONUTS."" DUKE walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) Those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts.  We wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the Absolute Cream of the National Sporting Press and we were gathered here, in Las Vegas, for a very special assignment.  And when it comes to things like this you don't fool around.  INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY  A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke. Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL SPORTING PRESS.  DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.  DUKE See...""Kill the body and the head will die""... the Frazier/Ali fight...  MAGAZINE REPORTER A proper end to the 60's... Ali beaten by a human hamburger!  DUKE And both Kennedy's murdered by mutants.  24.   A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.  REPORTER That's it!  They're starting!  In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking DUKE with them.  EXT. DESERT - DAY  MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS as they disappear into the desert...  A moment...  REPORTER Well, that's that.  They'll be back in an hour or so.  Let's go back to the bar.  The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.  INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY  DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed. Drinks are ordered.  A shout from outside the tent goes up:  VOICE OFF Group 2!  The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.  EXT. DESERT - DAY  MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...  The CROWD head back for the bar.  INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY  The CROWD surge back to the bar.  VOICE OFF Group 3!  This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.  25.   DUKE (V/O) There was something like 190 more bikes waiting to start.  They were due to go off 10 at a time every 2 minutes.  DUKE hits the bar.  DUKE Beer!  A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.  HOODLUM God damn!  What day is this -- Saturday?  DUKE More like Sunday.  HOODLUM Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it? Last night I was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin' the Mint 400 today, so I says to my old lady, ""Man, I'm goin'."" So she gives me a lot of crap about it, so I start slappin' her around, and the next thing you know two guys I never seen before are beating me stupid.  VOICE OFF Group 4!  Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking up more clouds of dust.  HOODLUM Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I could think was, ""O Jesus, who's divorcing me this time?"" But then I remembered, by God!  I was here for the Mint 400. And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful to be here.  Just wonderful to be here with you people.  A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar -- grabs the BARTENDER.  26.   MAGAZINE REPORTER Senzaman wassyneeds!  DUKE (smacks the bar with his palm) Hell yes!  Bring us ten!  VOICE OFF Group 5!  MAGAZINE REPORTER (screams) I'll back it! (slides off his stool to the floor)   Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into the tent -- getting denser.  MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D) (on the floor) This is a magic moment in sport! It may never come again!  I once did the Triple Crown, but it was nothing like this.  A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to haul him up.  FROG-EYED WOMAN Please stand up!  You're a correspondent for a major national magazine who's name we can't get clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a very handsome man if you'd just stand up!  MAGAZINE REPORTER Listen, madam.  I'm damn near intolerably handsome down here where I am.  You'd go crazy if I stood up!  A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3 cameras slung round his neck.  LACERDA Club soda, please.  FROG-EYED WOMAN (to MAGAZINE REPORTER) Please!  I love Life!  27.   LACERDA (to DUKE) Man, it's great out there!  DUKE Lunatics.  LACERDA grins.  VOICE OFF Group 6!  LACERDA Meet you outside!  LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and out into the cloud of dust.  EXT. DESERT - DAY  Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.  Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits. The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.  DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.  DUKE (V/O) By 10 they were spread out all over the course.  It was no longer a race, now it was an Endurance Contest.  The idea of trying to ""cover this race"" in any conventional press sense was absurd.  A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA hangs out of the window.  LACERDA It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!  DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.  EXT. DESERT - DAY  IN THE BRONCO.  DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away at nothing at all!  28.   LACERDA I'll just keep trying different combos of film and lenses till I find one that works in this dust!  The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...  We hear music and voices singing:  BATTLE HYMN ""...As we go marching on When I reach my final campground, in that land beyond the sun, And the Great Commander asks me..."" [What did he ask you, Rusty?] ""Did you fight or did you run?""  A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE coughs, chokes, drinks beer.  BATTLE HYMN (continuing) [And what did you tell them, Rusty?] ""We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had...""  The sound of gun shots...  A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares: ""THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY.""  The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They yell over the roaring engines.  DUNE BUGGY DRIVER Where's the damn race?  DUKE Beats me.  We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.  DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his grip on an automatic weapon.  DUNE BUGGY DRIVER (suspiciously) What outfit you fellas with?  29.   DUKE The sporting press.  We're friendlies.  Hired geeks.  The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.  DUKE If you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He's the man responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.  DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1 HOT DAMN!  DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A black jeep, you say?  And they ROAR away.  DUKE Take me back to the pits.  LACERDA No, no -- we have to go on.  We need total coverage.  DUKE gets out of the Bronco.  DUKE You're fired.  After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.  DUKE (V/O) It was time.  I felt, for an Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole scene.  The race was definitely under way.  I had witnessed the start; I was sure of that much. But what now?  EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT  MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST SOULS.  30.   DUKE Turn up the radio!  Turn up the tape machine!  Roll the windows down.  Let's taste this cool desert wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what it's all about!  DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world. GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.  DUKE (V/O) Total control now.  Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!  GONZO How about ""Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?"" ""Hot Slots,"" that sounds heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...  DUKE Look, what are we doing here?  Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?  GONZO To do the job, of course.  Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!  The Shark hits a bump.  GONZO As your attorney I advise you to drive over to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in the Blue Room with his Royal Canadians.  They hit another bump.  DUKE Why?  GONZO Why what?  CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.  31.   DUKE Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse. I don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be Hep.  EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT  TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.  DOORMAN #1 What the hell are you doing?!  DOORMAN #2 You can't park here!  DUKE Why not?  Is this not a reasonable place to park?  Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.  GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the DOORMAN.  GONZO We want this car parked!  We drove all the way from L.A. for this show. We're friends of Debbie's.  A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.  INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT  DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored, sleek, classy.  DUKE Holy shit!  They almost had us there!  That was quick thinking.  GONZO What do you expect?  I'm your attorney.  You owe me five bucks. I want it now.  DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.  32.   DUKE (V/O) This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It seemed inappropriate to be haggling about nickel/dime bribes for the parking lot attendant.  A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the ballroom.  WINE-COLORED TUXEDO Sorry, full house.  GONZO Goddamnit, we drove all the way from L.A.  WINE-COLORED TUXEDO I said there are no seats left... at any price.  GONZO Fuck seats!  We're old friends of Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.  GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm- waving negotiation.  DUKE (V/O) After a lot of bad noise, he let us in for nothing provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke.  As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED ""SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.""  A beat.  The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING WITH LAUGHTER.  GONZO Jesus creeping shit!  DUKE (tears streaming) Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!  33.   GONZO (in hysteria) We wandered into a fucking time capsule!  EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT  DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.  DUKE (in hysteria) We wandered into a fucking time capsule!  THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...  GONZO What's this?...  GONZO is instantly MOROSE.  GONZO That scum...  GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.  GONZO SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll find you and burn down your fucking house!  EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT  A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.  The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.  DUKE This is the place.  They'll never fuck with us here.  GONZO Where's the ether?  This mescaline isn't working.  EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT  Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS NOSE.  34.   DUKE (V/O) Ah, devil ether.  It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- (throws away kleenex) The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column.  Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.  DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care- taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.  DUKE (V/O) You approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there, everything goes wrong.  THE ETHER KICKS IN:  DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES, GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.  DUKE (V/O) Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on?  Then you hear yourself mumbling.  DUKE (mumbling) Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?  GONZO Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.  The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.  35.   DUKE (V/O) Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas.  In this town they love a drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside.  INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT  Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE KOREAN KITTENS.  The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly locked in a death battle.  All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD, THE ROLL OF A DICE.  DUKE (V/O) Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich.  Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to move out of the way.  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth but, nobody should be asked to handle this trip.  GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths. One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.  FAIRGROUND BARKER Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend.  For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas.  On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.  36.   FAIRGROUND BARKER 99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet tall!  ANOTHER BARKER Step right up!  Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat!  INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT  DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.  GONZO I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me.  I think I'm getting The Fear.  DUKE Nonsense.  We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.  GONZO That's what gives me The Fear.  DUKE Look over there.  Two women fucking a Polar Bear.  GONZO Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. (signals the waitress for two Wild Turkeys) This is my last drink.  How much money can you lend me?  DUKE Not much.  Why?  GONZO I have to go.  DUKE GO?  37.   GONZO Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.  DUKE Calm down.  You'll be straight in a few hours.  GONZO No.  This is serious.  One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!  DUKE OK.  I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.  GONZO Can we make it?  DUKE That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.  GONZO I want to leave fast.  DUKE OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly.  It's going to be a long walk. (signals waitress who comes over)   GONZO (suddenly to waitress) Do they pay you to screw that bear?  WAITRESS What?  DUKE He's just kidding. (to GONZO) Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs and gamble.  GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the turntable.  GONZO When does this thing stop?  38.   DUKE It won't stop.  It's not ever going to stop.  DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.  GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.  DUKE Don't move you'll come around.  DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps going around.  The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.  DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream. DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.  DUKE You fell.  Let's go.  GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched, looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?  DUKE (CONT'D) OK.  You stay here and go to jail. I'm leaving.  DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with him.  GONZO Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.  DUKE Probably the bartender.  He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.  GONZO Good God!  Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?  DUKE (turning him in the opposite direction) Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.  39.   EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT  DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.  DUKE Don't run.  They'd like any excuse to shoot us.  GONZO (in an extended fall) You drive!  I think there's something wrong with me.  INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.  GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.  GONZO Those bastards have changed the lock on us.  They probably searched the room.  Jesus, we're finished!  The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  GONZO Bolt everything!  Use all chains!  DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.  GONZO Where did this one come from?  DUKE snatches a key.  DUKE That's Lacerda's room.  GONZO smiles a slow smile...  GONZO Yeah... I thought we might need it...  DUKE What for?  GONZO snatches the key back.  40.   GONZO Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.  DUKE No, we should leave the poor bastard alone.  I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.  GONZO Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's watching us like a hawk.  DUKE He told me he was turning in early...  GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both hands.  GONZO That dirty bastard!  I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!  DUKE (laughing) That little blonde groupie with the film crew?  You think he sodomized her?  GONZO That's right, laugh about it!  You goddamn honkies are all the same!  GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.  DUKE Where'd you get that knife?  GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.  GONZO Room service sent it up.  I wanted something to cut the limes.  GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!  DUKE What limes?  GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!  41.   GONZO They didn't have any.  They don't grow in the desert.  SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I should have taken him out when I had the chance.  Now he has her.  SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!  DUKE watches -- straight-faced.  DUKE (V/O) I remember the girl.  We'd had a problem with her in the elevator a few hours earlier: my attention had made a fool of himself.  INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)  An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.  DUKE and GONZO stagger in.  LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.  BLONDE TV REPORTER (to Gonzo) You must be a rider.  What class are you in?  GONZO Class?  What the fuck do you mean?  BLONDE TV REPORTER What do you ride?  We're filming the race for a TV series -- maybe we can use you.  GONZO Use me?  DUKE (V/O) Mother of God, I thought.  Here it comes.  GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.  42.   GONZO (suddenly shouting) I ride the BIG ONES!  The really BIG fuckers!  GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to defuse the scene.  DUKE The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're with the Factory Team.  TV CAMERAMAN Bullshit.  GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...  GONZO Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but I think there's some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker in this car who needs his face cut open.  You cheap honky faggots!  Which one of you wants to get cut?!  DEAD SILENCE.  Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door closes.  Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.  INT. CORRIDOR - DAY  DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.  GONZO Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like rats in a death cage!  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY  DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR. GONZO stops laughing.  GONZO Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That girl understood.  She fell in love with me.  END FLASHBACK.  43.   INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE -- sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.  GONZO Let's go up there and castrate that fucker!  GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.  GONZO (squinting suspiciously) Have you made a deal with him?  Did you put him on to her?  DUKE (backing slowly towards the door) Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight.  I have to put the car in the lot.  DUKE (V/O) One of the things you learn, after years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug.  Especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eyes.  INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL  The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.  MAGAZINE REPORTER Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are still asleep, the dust is still on the desert, fifty thousand dollars in prize money, slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb's fabulous Mint Hotel...  DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD, MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.  DUKE (V/O) Who are these people?  These faces! Where do they come from?  They look like caricatures of used car dealers from Dallas. (MORE)  44.   DUKE (V/O; CONT'D) And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at four-thirty on a Monday morning.  Still humping the American dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute predawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.  DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.  DUKE You bastards!  DUKE (V/O) No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY losing.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF THREE DOG NIGHT'S ""JOY TO THE WORLD.""  He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT  Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub. Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over the sink.  DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED UP WHITE BLOTTER.  DUKE You ate ALL THIS ACID?  No answer.  DUKE (turning down the volume) You evil son of a bitch.  You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.  GONZO Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape on.  45.   DUKE What tape?  GONZO Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit."" I want a rising sound.  DUKE You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.  GONZO I dig my own graves.  Green water and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.  DUKE OK.  But do me one last favor, will you.  Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow.  I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.  He switches on the tape. ""WHITE RABBIT"" begins to build.  GONZO (coolly) Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?  DUKE How about a check?  GONZO Whatever's right.  DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and leaves, closing the door behind him.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted. Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.  GONZO (V/O) Help!  You bastard!  I need help!  46.   DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.  DUKE Shit, he's killing himself!  INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT  DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its mounts.  GONZO (snarling) I want that fucking radio!  DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.  DUKE Don't touch it!  Get back in that tub!  GONZO Back the tape up.  I need it again! Let it roll!  Just as high as the fucker can go!  And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!  DUKE stares down at GONZO.  DUKE Not me.  It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!  GONZO BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.  HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.  DUKE Jesus.  GONZO Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!  DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.  47.   DUKE Okay.  You're right.  This is probably the only solution. (holds the PLUGGED IN TAPE/RADIO over the tub) Let me make sure I have it all lined up.  You want me to throw this thing into the tub when ""WHITE RABBIT"" peaks.  Is that it?  GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.  GONZO Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.  DUKE Are you ready?  He switches ""WHITE RABBIT"" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.  Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when ""WHITE RABBIT"" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.  GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A TIDAL WAVE.  DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF THE BATHROOM.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE slumps onto the sofa.  SILENCE.  GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.  DUKE MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?  GONZO stops -- hisses.  GONZO You bastard!  You'd do that, wouldn't you?  48.   DUKE (laughs) Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...  GONZO You cheap honky sonofabitch...  DUKE Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me!  What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!  GONZO The cops?  DUKE There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!  GONZO (mumbles) Who said anything about slicing you up?  I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead.  Nothing serious.  GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.  DUKE (menaces him with the MACE) Get back in that tub.  Eat some reds and try to calm down.  Smoke some grass, shoot some smack -- shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest.  GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.  GONZO Hell, yes.  You really need some sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn. What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't let me keep you up.  49.   GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next to the clock.  DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.  DUKE (V/O) Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the Love Generation.  The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.  DUKE (V/O) My attorney had never been able to accept the notion -- often espoused by former drug abusers -- that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them.  And neither have I, for that matter.  The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.  INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT  A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.  DUKE (V/O) I recall one night in the Matrix. There I was -- a victim of the Drug Explosion.  A natural street freak, just eating whatever came by.  A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.  ROAD-PERSON Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I got all the makin's right here. All I need is a place to cook.  The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.  INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT  Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.  50.   DUKE (V/O) I decided to eat only half at first. Good thinking.  But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton shirt.  DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in slow-motion.  MUSICIAN What's the trouble?  DUKE (also in slow-motion) Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD.  The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A long pause.  Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean- cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror. We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side... sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.  DUKE (V/O) With a bit of luck his life was ruined -- forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars, men in red Pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know.  INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT  The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a TV white noise snowstorm.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE sits staring at the TV.  51.   DUKE (V/O) Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. (he gets up, pours himself a drink) Has it been five years?  Six?  It seems like a lifetime -- the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.  But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.  Whatever it meant.  DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.  EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE  We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.  DUKE (V/O) THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT, THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY prevail.  We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...  DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  DUKE (V/O) So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark -- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.  52.   The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas. Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi shouting ""WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!""  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.  INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN  A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.  DUKE (V/O) The decision to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not.  DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.  BELL BOY Room service!  The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.  DUKE (V/O) Maybe I'd planned it all along -- subconsciously waiting for the right moment.  The bill was a factor, I think.  Because I had no money to pay for it.  DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.  DUKE (V/O) Our room service tabs had been running somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour, for forty-eight consecutive hours.  Incredible. How could it happen?  DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room -- empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...  DUKE (V/O) But by the time I asked this question, there was no one around to answer.  DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.  53.   DUKE (V/O) My attorney was gone.  He must have sensed trouble.  QUICK CUT TO:  EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY  GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of brand-new fine cowhide luggage.  DUKE (V/O) Panic.  INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY  DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase -- leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both ways, then hurries away down the corridor.  DUKE (V/O) It crept up my spine like first rising vibes of an acid frenzy. All these horrible realities began to dawn on me.  INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY  An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...  DUKE (V/O) Here I was, alone in Las Vegas, with this goddamned incredibly expensive car, completely twisted on drugs, no cash, no story for the magazine.  And on top of everything else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.  DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.  The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN HANDCUFFS.  DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors close.  DUKE (V/O) I didn't even know who had won the race.  Maybe nobody.  54.   INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY  DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.  DUKE (muttering to himself) How would Horatio Alger have handled this situation?  EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY  Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves at the CAR BOY.  DUKE (V/O) Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a relatively respectable citizen -- a multiple felon, perhaps, but certainly not dangerous.  The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint 400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) Luckily, I had taken the soap and grapefruit and other luggage out to the car a few hours earlier.  Now it was only a matter of slipping the noose...  DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!  CLERK'S VOICE MR. DUKE!  DUKE freezes.  CLERK'S VOICE Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for you!  DUKE (V/O) The game was up!  They had me.  DUKE (to himself) Well, why not?  Many fine books have been written in prison.  55.   Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS HAND.  CLERK Sir? (thrusts out a TELEGRAM) This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you.  It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does that make sense?  DUKE (barely able to speak) Yes... It makes sense.  DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.  The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous stash inside.  CLERK I checked the register for this man Thompson.  We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.  DUKE He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to him.  He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.  SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word or two.  CLERK What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles.  When we knew he was right here in the hotel.  DUKE You did the right thing.  Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.  CLERK Tell me.  When will the doctor be awake?  56.   DUKE (tenses) Awake?  What do you mean?  DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.  CLERK (uncomfortably) Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him.  Nothing unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.  DUKE Of course.  But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very crude man.  DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.  CLERK But he will be available?  Perhaps later this morning?  DUKE Look.  That telegram was all scrambled.  It was actually from Thompson, not to him.  Western Union must have gotten the names reversed.  I have to get going.  I have to get out to the track.  CLERK There's no hurry!  The race is over!  DUKE (taking off) Not for me.  He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.  CLERK Let's have lunch!  DUKE Righto!  EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY  DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.  57.   A ""YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS"" sign flashes past.  Bob Dylan plays: ""Memphis Blues Again -- ""Aaww, Mama, can this really by the end...?""  A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.  DUKE (V/O) Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing -- intolerable vibrations in this place.  Get out!  The weasels were closing in.  I could smell the ugly brutes.  Flee!  DUKE drives fast.  DUKE Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert.  A sign flashes ""YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.""  A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.  DUKE (CONT'D) You evil bastard!  This is your work!  You'd better take care of me, Lord... because if you don't you're going to have me on your hands.  The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.  DUKE (V/O) Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a Highway Traffic Cop.  Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.  This is wrong.  DUKE floors the gas pedal.  DUKE (V/O) It arouses contempt in the cop heart.  THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.  58.   DUKE (V/O) Make the bastard chase you.  He will follow.  But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.  DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.  DUKE (V/O) This is to let him know you're looking for a proper place to pull off and talk.  AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.  DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.  DUKE (V/O) It will take him a moment to realize that he is about to make 180 degree turn at speed... but you will be ready for it, braced for the G's and the fast heel toe work.  The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.  EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY  The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.  The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Just what the FUCK did you think you were doing?!  DUKE smiles.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN May I see your license.  DUKE Of course, officer.  DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.  DUKE (V/O) I knew I was fucked.  The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.  59.   HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Could I have that, please?  DUKE Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.  The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer -- glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN You realize...  DUKE Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I understand that.  I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway.  Shit, why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN That's a strange attitude.  He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap.  There's a rest area up ahead.  Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?  DUKE A nap won't help.  I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights.  I can't even remember.  If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.  The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?  DUKE How far is Baker?  I was hoping to stop there for lunch.  60.   HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Not my jurisdiction.  The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area.  Can you make it that far?  DUKE I'll try.  I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time.  I've heard a lot about it.  The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.  HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Excellent seafood.  With a mind like yours, you'll probably want to try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic Diner.  The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.  EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY  DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.  DUKE (V/O) I felt raped.  The Pig had done me on all fronts, and now he was going off to chuckle about it -- on the west side of town, waiting for me to make a run for L.A.  DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER drops his thumb.  DUKE Great Jesus, it's him.  DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE WAY HE CAME.  EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY  DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.  DUKE They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker.  I don't have much time.  The fuckers are closing in. They'll hunt me down like a beast!  61.   INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY  GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.  GONZO Who?  You sound a little paranoid.  EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY  DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.  DUKE You bastard!  I need a lawyer immediately!  INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY  GONZO What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?  EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY  DUKE What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in trouble.  You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that?  When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!  INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY  GONZO You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We have a suite at the Flamingo.  I was just about to leave for the airport.  INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY  DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.  GONZO'S VOICE You brainless scumbag!  You're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney's conference!  I made all the reservations... rented a white Cadillac convertible... the whole thing is arranged!  What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert?  62.   DUKE stares at the telegram.  DUKE Never mind.  It's all a big joke. I'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking from a portable phone.  Some dwarf brought it out from the casino.  I have total credit!  Can you grasp that? (shouts) Don't come anywhere near this place! Foreigners aren't welcome here!  DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.  EXT. DESERT - DAY  C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.  DUKE (V/O) Well.  This is how the world works.  C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.  DUKE (V/O) All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet.  C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert dirt.  DUKE (V/O) What a fool I was to defy Him.  The IGUANA sits unfazed.  DUKE (V/O) Never cross the Great Magnet.  I understood this now... (another blast from the gun) ... and with understanding came a sense of almost terminal relief.  DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the thuds of the explosions echo away.  EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY  The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.  63.   DUKE (V/O) I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too many people might recognize it... ...especially the Vegas Police. (tight C/U of DUKE) Luckily, my credit card was still technically valid.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE WHITE WHALE.  DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.  DUKE (V/O) This was a superior machine -- ten grand worth of gimmicks and high price special effects.  The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamited pond.  The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand.  EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON  A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.  DUKE (V/O) If the Pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture should be represented as well... and there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas hotel and then just wheeling across town and checking into another.  The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately attended by impressed MINIONS.  DUKE (V/O) Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America.  Why not?  Move confidently into their midst.  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON  DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.  64.   DUKE (V/O) My arrival was badly timed.  THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts, Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.  Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK. The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side, weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.  POLICE CHIEF What do you mean I'm too late to register?  I'm a police chief. From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told you. (waves a POSTCARD) I have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel.  CLERK (prissily) I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the ""late list."" Your reservations were transferred to the... ah... Moonlight Motel, which is out on Paradise Boulevard...  POLICE CHIEF I've already paid for my goddamn room!  CLERK It's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and...  POLICE CHIEF You dirty little faggot!  Call the manager!  I'm tired of listening to this dogshit!  FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.  CLERK (solicitously) I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you a cab?  The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...  DUKE (V/O) Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...  65.   CLERK (IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION) Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross- section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. ""Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you.""  DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.  DUKE Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I wonder if maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way.  Name's Raoul Duke -- Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the reservation.  DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.  CLERK Certainly, Mr. Duke!  DUKE My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible.  Can you have someone drive it around to the room?  ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.  DUKE Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?  CLERK Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.  DUKE Well, thank you.  DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of beer and toasts them.  The doors close.  66.   INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY  DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.  DUKE Ah, home at last!  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON  DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.  A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.  GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a drug-addled grin on his face.  DUKE You degenerate pig!  GONZO It can't be helped.  This is Lucy. (laughing distractedly) You know--like ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.""  LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.  GONZO Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport!  No more of that, okay?  LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder.  GONZO Lucy... this is my client.  This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side.  DUKE flops onto the sofa.  GONZO Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves artists.  DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.  GONZO Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand.  67.   LUCY I drew these from TV.  GONZO Fantastic.  She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra.  We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage...  DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.  DUKE (V/O) I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on this.  Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.  DUKE Well, I guess they brought the car round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF OUT OF THE TRUNK.  DUKE fixes GONZO hard.  GONZO Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF. (to LUCY) Now, we'll be right back.  Don't answer the phone if it rings.  LUCY (makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign) God bless.  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY  DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.  DUKE WELL?  What are your plans?  GONZO Plans?  DUKE Lucy.  68.   GONZO (struggling to focus) Shit.  I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. (he shrugs) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.  DUKE Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.  GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.  GONZO Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months.  It's terrible.  DUKE She's perfect for this gig.  These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.  We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.  GONZO's face twitches badly.  GONZO Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.  DUKE It's straight economics.  This girl is a god-send.  Shit, she can make us a grand a day.  GONZO NO!  Stop talking like that.  DUKE I figure she can do about four at a time.  Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day.  Maybe three.  69.   GONZO You filthy bastard.  I should cave your fucking head in.  DUKE In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.  GONZO starts crying.  GONZO NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!  DUKE You'll go straight to the gas chamber.  And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consensual Sodomy.  She's got to go.  Pause.  GONZO Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days.  A silence.  DUKE (V/O) The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards.  But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.  GONZO We have to cut her loose.  She's got two hundred dollars.  And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.  DUKE What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?  70.   GONZO It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses.  Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.  DUKE Us?  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET  DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.  DUKE Hotel Americana?  I need a reservation.  For my niece.  Listen, I need her treated very gently. She's an artist, and might seem a trifle highstrung...  In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the door.  GONZO Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...  DUKE (V/O) I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.  EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK  The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings from the car.  DUKE (V/O) Lucy was a potentially fatal millstone on both our necks.  There was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and hope her memory was fucked.  GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER -- waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting to come down...  GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands together as if washing his hands of the situation.  GONZO Well that's that.  Take off slowly. Don't attract attention.  71.   They pull out into traffic.  EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK  GONZO I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe.  Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.  DUKE That's good.  You can't be subtle in this town.  GONZO As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.  DUKE Maybe we should take it easy tonight.  GONZO Right.  Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...  The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING  GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.  In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.  DUKE Come on, we're going to be late.  GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth with a towel.  GONZO This goddamn mescaline.  Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?  Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or something.  72.   INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (crackling and booming over the lousy sound system) On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county, I welcome you to the Third National DA's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.  The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads: NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. ""If You Don't Know, Come To Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach.""  A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around 20 REDNECKS.  A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.  At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.  GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT, CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.  GONZO (lowers his voice) I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!  DUKE They're actually nice people when you get to know them.  GONZO Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!  DUKE Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.  GONZO This is a fucking nightmare.  73.   DUKE Right.  Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.  COP IN BACK SSSSHHH!  DR. BLUMQUIST -- a ""drug expert"" -- takes the stage.  DR. BLUMQUIST We must come to terms with the Drug Culture in the country... country... country...  The sound systems echoes.  DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) The reefer butt is called a ""roach,"" because it resembles a cockroach... cockroach... cockroach...  GONZO (whispers) What the fuck are these people talking about?  You'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach!  DUKE (V/O) It was clear that we had stumbled into a prehistoric gathering.  DR. BLUMQUIST Now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square.  The square is seldom if ever cool.  He is not ""with it,"" that is, he doesn't know ""what's happening."" But if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to ""hip.""  DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.  DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) And if he can bring himself to approve of what is happening, he becomes ""groovy."" After that, with much luck and perseverance, he can rise to the rank of ""cool."" A cool guy... cool guy... cool guy...  74.   COP IN BACK Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the anthropologist, Margaret Mead's strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction?  DR. BLUMQUIST I really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip!  Roars of laughter.  GONZO I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit.  He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and plunges down the aisle to the door.  COP IN BACK Down in front!  GONZO Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I don't belong here!  COP IN BACK Good riddance!  He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to the stage.  The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.  FILM NARRATOR KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension...  DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.  FILM NARRATOR ... and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim...  75.   DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness, he gets up, hand over mouth.  DUKE Pardon me, I feel sick.  FILM NARRATOR He will stagger and babble when questioned.  He will not respect your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears nothing.  He will attack, for no reason, with every weapon at his command -- including yours...  DUKE heads for the exit.  DUKE Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling sick...  FILM NARRATOR BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately. One stitch in time [on him] will usually save nine on you.  DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.  INT. CASINO BAR - DAY  DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.  DA I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...  GONZO You will.  One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.  DA Naw!  GONZO They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives.  They might even sit on your wife's chest.  Put the blade right down on her throat.  76.   DA Not down in my parts.  DUKE joins them.  DUKE (to WAITRESS) Rum and ice, please.  DA (looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG) You're another one of these California boys.  Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.  DUKE They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it.  In L.A. it's out of control.  First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.  DA Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!  The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the conversation.  GONZO Read the newspapers.  DUKE Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!  DA Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!  DUKE Not where we operate.  GONZO Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day.  All they want is the blood.  They'll take people right off the street if they have to.  77.   DUKE Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!  The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more furiously.  DA What happened?  What did they do to her?  GONZO Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot!  Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!  DA (DA ad-libs a summation of the crime) And nobody did anything?  DUKE What could they do?  The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.  GONZO They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...  DUKE Like big lizards.  GONZO ... and every one of them stacked naked...  DA Naked!?  DUKE Naked.  78.   GONZO Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.  DUKE They were all veterans.  DA Veterans?!!!?  Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes the glass -- faster and faster...  GONZO Yeh.  The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.  DA A major!  GONZO We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.  DA Naw!  Not a major.  GONZO He wanted the pineal gland.  DA Really?  GONZO That's how he got so big.  When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.  DUKE Usually, it's whole families. During the night.  Most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going -- and then, of course, it's too late.  The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.  DUKE (CONT'D) Happens every day.  DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.  79.   DUKE (CONT'D) Three more rums.  Plenty of ice. Maybe a handful of lime chunks.  WAITRESS Are you guys with the police convention upstairs?  DA We sure are, Miss.  WAITRESS I thought so.  I never heard that kind of talk around here before. Jesus Christ!  How do you guys stand that kind of work?  GONZO (grinning) We like it.  It's groovy.  The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.  DUKE What's wrong with you?  Hell, somebody has to do it.  GONZO Hurry up with those drinks.  We're thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine a Bloody Mary.  DA (whacks his fist on the bar) Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later.  Mostly Atlanta.  But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance.  They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.  GONZO (with a conspiratorial nod) You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.  80.   DA What do you mean by that?  GONZO You know what I mean.  We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!  DUKE Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every one of them.  That's what we're doing in California.  DA (stupefied) WHAT?  GONZO Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.  DUKE We keep it quiet.  It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.  Not with the press around.  DA (recovering slightly) Hell, no.  We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.  DUKE Dobermans don't talk.  DA What?  GONZO Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.  DUKE They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.  DA God almighty! (muttering in a daze) I don't think I should tell my wife about this.  She'd never understand. You know how women are.  81.   DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.  DUKE Just be thankful your heart is young and strong.  DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the swirling ice in drink.  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY  DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.  GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.  The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer, picks up the phone.  DUKE What's the message?  My light is blinking.  CLERK (V/O) Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one message: ""Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600.""  DUKE Holy shit!  DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the bathroom -- looking like death.  DUKE Lucy called.  GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.  GONZO What?  The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY  A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.  CLERK Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...  82.   INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY  DUKE WHAT? (hand over the PHONE) What was that crazy bitch said to him? (screams) There's a war on, man!  People are being killed!  CLERK (V/O) Killed?  DUKE IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!  CLERK (V/O) Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war.  When will it end?  DUKE Tell me.  What do you want?  In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his stash from the lining.  CLERK (V/O) The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed.  I think she was crying...  DUKE Crying?  Why was she crying?  CLERK (V/O) Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...  DUKE Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.  CLERK (V/O) (hesitantly) Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...  83.   DUKE Don't worry.  You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.  CLERK (V/O) What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?  DUKE Of course.  And now I have to get back to the news.  Send up some ice.  He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.  GONZO Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.  DUKE (slowly, carefully) Lucy is looking for you.  GONZO (laughing) No, she's looking for you.  DUKE Me?  GONZO She really flipped over you.  The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. (laughing again) I guess she figures you won.  That phone message wasn't for me, was it?  A look of stunned realization from DUKE...  INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY  LUCY is on the witness stand.  LUCY Yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel.  84.   A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.  LUCY I don't know for sure what they done to me, but I remember it was horrible.  JUDGE Twenty years... and Double Castration!  The JUDGE bangs his gavel.  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY  DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.  GONZO Wait!  You can't leave me alone in this snake pit.  This room is in my name.  DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.  GONZO OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her.  I'll get her off our backs. You're right.  She's my problem.  DUKE It's gone too far.  GONZO Relax.  Let me handle this. (dials the PHONE, snaps angrily at DUKE) You'd make a piss-poor lawyer. ...Room 1600, please. (to DUKE) As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. (nods towards bathroom) Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.  DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a label: ""DRINK ME.""  DUKE What is this?  85.   GONZO You won't need much.  Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.  DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.  DUKE Adrenochrome...  GONZO (into PHONE) Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got your message...what?  Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...  DUKE (V/O) I remember thinking, ""Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.""  DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...  GONZO (to PHONE) But here's the problem.  That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference.  They'll be looking for both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, Lucy.  Some people are just basically rotten... Anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars... no, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away.  I have to go, they've got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now... OH MY GOD! THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN! (throws the PHONE down; shouts) No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent! It was Duke!  I swear to God! (MORE)  86.   GONZO (CONT'D) (stomps the PHONE; moans) No, I don't know where she is. You'll never catch Lucy!  She's gone!  I swear, I don't know where she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME! (slams the PHONE down)   GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.  GONZO Well.  That's that.  She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now.  That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy. (fumbling with the hash pipe) Where's the opium?  DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...  DUKE (V/O) I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies.  But the room was quiet again.  DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.  DUKE Where'd you get this?  GONZO Never mind, it's absolutely pure.  DUKE Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!  GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.  87.   GONZO I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me.  He's one of these Satanism freaks.  He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life. (laughs -- struts round DUKE -- eyes bright with expectation) I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.  DUKE (V/O) I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...  DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...  GONZO Yeah, they nailed this guy for child molesting.  He swore he didn't do it. ""Why should I fuck with children?"" he says. ""They're too small."" Christ, werewolf is entitled to legal counsel.  I didn't dare turn the creep down. He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland!  GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.  DUKE Why not?  We should get some of that.  Just eat a big handful and see what happens.  GONZO Some of what?  DUKE (spitting words) Extract of pineal!  88.   GONZO (STARING AT DUKE WITH A STRANGE SMILE) Sure.  That's a good idea.  One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.  GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.  GONZO Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...  A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.  DUKE Right!  GONZO ... grow claws... bleeding warts.  GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.  DUKE Yes!  GONZO ... then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...  A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A FLAME RED DEMON!  DUKE Fantastic!  DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED, EYEBALLS SWELLING.  GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.  GONZO you'd go blind... your body would turn to wax... they'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and...  GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.  89.   GONZO Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.  DUKE FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What happened?!  What about the glands?  GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily... towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...  GONZO Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it.  VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red. OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!  DUKE Maybe you could just... shove me into the pool, or something...  GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.  GONZO If I put you in the pool right now, you'd sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much.  Jesus, look at your face, you're about to explode.  GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.  GONZO Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles.  Strokes, aneurysms.  You'll just wither up and die.  DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO PARALYSIS.  AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.  NIXON Sacrifice... sacrifice... sacrifice...  DUKE PASSES OUT.  BLACK SCREEN  90.   INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- ""Put the lime in the coconut and mix em all up...""  DUKE (V/O) What kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song -- right now, at this moment?  DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies, awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been there days -- months.  DUKE (V/O) When I came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul.  How long had I been lying there?  Hours? Days?  Months?  All these signs of violence.  What had happened?  DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere, pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror.  DUKE (V/O) There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD.  DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet -- HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.  DUKE (V/O) But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?  Would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?  These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all this booze?  And these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust...  DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.  91.   DUKE (V/O) These were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.  It was too savage, too aggressive.  QUICK FLASHBACK:  GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:  BACK IN THE ROOM:  DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.  DUKE (V/O) Grim memories and bad flashbacks.  In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.  DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE MAGNUM .357!  DUKE (V/O) Something ugly had happened.  I was sure of it...  DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.  The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.  DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF... sleeping on the sofa.  The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.  A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is muffling her screams with an ice bag.  MAID Please... please... I'm only the maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...  DUKE (jumps up from the bed, flashing his press badge) YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!  92.   GONZO (to DUKE) She must have used a pass key.  I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I took her.  DUKE shakes his head.  DUKE (barks at the MAID) What made you do it?  Who paid you off?  MAID Nobody.  I'm the maid!  GONZO You're lying!  You were after the evidence.  Who put you up to this -- the manager?  MAID I don't know what you're talking about!  GONZO Bullshit!  You're just as much a part of it as they are!  MAID Part of what?  DUKE The dope ring.  You must know what's going on in this hotel.  Why do you think we're here?  MAID (blubbering) I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention.  I swear!  All I wanted to do was clean up the room.  I don't know anything about dope!  GONZO laughs.  GONZO Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.  93.   MAID No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!  DUKE Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.  MAID No!  I swear I'm not!  GONZO (long pause) In that case, maybe she can help.  MAID Yes!  I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!  DUKE So do we, lady.  GONZO (helping her up) I think we should put her on the payroll.  See what she comes up with.  DUKE Do you think you can handle it?  MAID What?  GONZO One phone call every day.  Just tell us what you've seen.  Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.  GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.  MAID You'd pay me for that?  DUKE You're damn right.  But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?  MAID Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.  94.   GONZO Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a politician.  DUKE Inspector Rock will pay you.  In cash.  A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.  MAID Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything for that!  GONZO You and a lot of other people.  DUKE The password is: ""One Hand Washes The Other."" The minute you hear that, you say ""I fear nothing.""  MAID I fear nothing.  She repeats the password several times while they listen to make sure she has it right.  GONZO Oh, and don't bother to make up the room.  That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?  MAID Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...  GONZO Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.  She smiles, repeating to herself ""One Hand Washes The Other"" as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.  CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.  A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.  GONZO ON TAPE ... Thank God for the decent people.  95.   DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his mangled tape recorder in front of him.  DUKE (V/O) Memories of that night are extremely hazy...  DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: ""Awwww, mama... can this really...be the end...?""  EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY  The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.  DUKE (V/O) There is a definite obligation, when you boom around Vegas in a white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a certain style.  DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.  The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.  DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!  A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.  DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat flies everywhere.  SHOPPER #1 Hey!  Is that your car?  DUKE Sure is.  SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.  DUKE Any of you folks want the milk? We're after the meat.  This is honest coconut essence.  Real meat.  SMASH!  96.   SHOPPER #2 Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing to that car!  GONZO Fuck the car.  They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.  SMASH!  DUKE Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!  SHOPPER #3 Someone should stop them!  SMASH!  DUKE You poor fools don't understand, do you?  This car is the property of the World Bank!  That money goes to ITALY!  SHOPPER #3 Somebody should call the police!  GONZO Police?  Are you people crazy?  GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in the other.  GONZO (CONT'D) You folks every heard of ole Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!  Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.  GONZO (CONT'D) (ROARS) GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!  GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!  A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.  GONZO (CONT'D) In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!  SHOPPER #3 Bullshit.  97.   The CROWD move in.  SHOPPER #1 Call the goddamn police!  GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!  SHOPPER #4 Look what they've done to that beautiful car!  DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.  DUKE This crowd is not rational.  They can't relate to us.  Let's go!  A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.  DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.  DUKE You people voted for Hubert Humphrey! You killed Jesus!  They swerve round and through the CROWD.  DUKE (V/O) The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody wants to be run over by a Coupe de Ville.  INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...  VOICE ON TAPE You found the American Dream?  In this town?  DUKE ON TAPE We're sitting on the main nerve right now...  INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT  DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!  98.   DUKE The manager told me a story about the owner of this place...about how he always wanted to run away and join the circus when he was a kid. Well, now the bastard has his own circus, and a license to steal, too.  3RD MAN You're right -- he's the model.  DUKE Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger... Say...  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE playing the tape.  DUKE ON TAPE ... how much do you think he'd take for the ape?  DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES. SCREECH OF BRAKES.  VOICE ON TAPE Holy God!...  A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.  EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT  RENTAL AGENT Holy God!, how did this happen?  DUKE They beat the shit out of it.  RENTAL AGENT The top's completely jammed!  The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.  DUKE Yeah, something's wrong with the motor...  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE ON TAPE ... The generator light's been on red ever since I drove the thing into Lake Mead on a water test...  99.   A HUGE SPLASH...  The tape's gone too far.  DUKE No, no.  Shit...  DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.  DUKE ON TAPE Where's the ape?  I'm ready to write a check.  INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT  DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY. DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.  3RD MAN Forget it, he just attacked an old man... he took a bite out of the bartender's head!  The cops took the ape away.  DUKE Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I want that ape!  I've already reserved two first-class seats on the plane.  DUKE (V/O) There was every reason to believe that we had been heading for trouble, that we'd pushed our luck a bit far...  INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT  GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.  GONZO Hey there!  You folks want to buy some heroin?  In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out -- close to them.  100.   GONZO Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm serious.  I want to sell you some pure fucking smack!  No reaction.  GONZO Cheap heroin!  This is the real stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I just got back from Vietnam!  This is scag, folks.  Pure scag!  The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with them.  GONZO Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood! Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist! Jab it right in your fucking eyeballs!  The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged, lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.  MAN IN CAR You dirty bastards!  Pull over and I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You bastards!  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  BACK IN THE SUITE:  The tapes runs:  MAN IN CAR ON TAPE You dirty bastards!  An ugly squeal of brakes.  GONZO ON TAPE Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I shoulda maced the fucker!  DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds ski to a halt...  DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape, then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A CHILLING MOMENT...  DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?  101.   READ ON TO FIND OUT!  DUKE (remembering) Back door beauty!  DUKE (V/O) The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.  DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) The possibility of physical and mental collapse is very real... No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the ride...  HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...  VOICE OFF Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!  EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT  WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.  DUKE (V/O) North Vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on The Strip and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate Downtown places.  PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the counter.  INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT  DUKE (V/O) The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just a place to rest and regroup.  I wasn't even hungry.  GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.  102.   DUKE (V/O) There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...  GONZO (to WAITRESS) Two glasses of ice water with ice.  The WAITRESS brings the ice water.  DUKE (V/O) She looked like a burnt out caricature of Jane Russell.  She was definitely in charge here...  GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.  DUKE (V/O) He did it very casually, but I knew that our peace was about to be shattered.  DUKE What was that?  GONZO shrugs.  The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.  WAITRESS What is this?  GONZO A napkin.  THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.  WAITRESS Don't give me that bullshit!  I know what it means!  You goddamn fat pimp bastard.  GONZO That's the name of a horse I used to own.  What's wrong with you?  WAITRESS You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of shit in this place, but I sure as hell don't have to take it off a SPIC PIMP!  103.   GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...  DUKE (V/O) Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?  DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red letters: ""BACK DOOR BEAUTY?""  DUKE (V/O CONT'D) The question mark was emphasized.  WAITRESS (screams) Pay your bill and get the hell out! You want me to call the cops?  GONZO Spic pimp?  GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR- SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.  GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone. He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool and sits down.  DUKE (V/O) I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.  GONZO (casual) How much is the lemon meringue pie?  DUKE (V/O) Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.  WAITRESS (blurting -- on automatic) Thirty-five cents!  GONZO (laughing) I mean the whole pie.  The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.  GONZO Let's say five dollars.  Okay?  104.   GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE DISPLAY CASE.  DUKE (V/O) The sight of the blade had triggered bad memories.  The glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.  She was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.  DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.  GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.  The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy bar at night.  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT  DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...  GONZO (V/O) Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have fifteen fucking minutes to get me on that plane!  EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY  The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP, TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION as the light turns red.  DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.  DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.  GONZO What are you doing?  You were supposed to turn back there!  DUKE (V/O) We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.  The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.  DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  105.   GONZO Jesus Christ!!!  There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...  DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS OFF.  EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY  THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO looks wildly around.  GONZO Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road?  GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT RUNWAY.  GONZO The airport is over there!  DUKE Never missed a plane yet.  DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING, HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the RUNWAY.  GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He throws a worried look at DUKE.  DUKE I'll drop you right next to the plane.  They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET ENGINE SCREAM.  GONZO No!  I can't get out!  They'll crucify me.  I'll have to take the blame!  106.   DUKE (irritatedly) Ridiculous!  Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up.  You never saw me before.  Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles.  I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate.  You ready?  GONZO Why not?  But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!  EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY  DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.  DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.  DUKE Hey!  GONZO stops -- turns.  DUKE Don't take any guff from those swine.  Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.  GONZO Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...  GONZO pauses.  GONZO Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains.  GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.  DUKE (V/O) There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.  Too weird to live and too rare to die.  107.   DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.  INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT  On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his typewriter.  DUKE We are all wired into a survival trip now.  No more of the speed that fueled that 60's.  That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously...  DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.  DUKE All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit.  But their loss and failure is ours too.  What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create...  RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30 FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...  DUKE ... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force -- is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.  HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.  108.   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY  A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out of the back seat as he takes a bump.  DUKE (V/O) There was only one road back to L.A. US Interstate 15, just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity, just another freak in the Freak Kingdom.  DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon sign that flashes beer.  DUKE Ahhh.  Wonderful.  DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.  INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY  DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.  PROPRIETOR What'll you have?  DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.  DUKE (doubtfully) Ballantine Ale...?  THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND RELAXES.  DUKE Hard to find it served like this anymore.  As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.  109.   PROPRIETOR Where ya comin' from, young man?  DUKE Las Vegas.  PROPRIETOR A great town, that Vegas.  I bet you had good luck there.  You're the type.  DUKE I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.  PROPRIETOR (trustingly) That's a fine combination.  You can't lose.  A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and... KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.  DUKE (caught off guard... muttering) Oh, my God!...  PROPRIETOR (not understanding) This is my granddaughter...  DUKE (recovering) Don't worry... (leans forward in confidence) ... and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County. (winks) Just another good American like yourself.  A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.  Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.  WHO FEELS ASHAMED.  DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.  EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY  A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE. Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...  110.   A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.  Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...  DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the trembling dash... DUKE catches it...  ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...  DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP -- TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.  DUKE HOLY SHIT!!!  DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT THE MARINES.  DUKE GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!  DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!  AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.  EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY  DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!  DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.  DUKE (V/O) My heart was filled with joy.  I felt like a monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger... a man on the move... and just sick enough to be totally confident.  The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.  AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  END",[],83,1988-05-22,Standing In The Sun,https://genius.com/Universal-pictures-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-script-annotated,[],2012.0
