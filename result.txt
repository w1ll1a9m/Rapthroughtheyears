effort to search and or annette an artists lyric separates casual listeners from loyal fan genius analysis can truly determine who made the biggest impact in calendar year so with that in mind we decided to breakdown lyric driven tends in 201 most viewed songs in 20142014 really felt like the year of the single while we missed major label offerings from the game is hottest my is we had an abundance of outstanding singles features and breakthrough artists the likes of bobby shmurda rich gang and are sremurd dropped memegenerating songs quicker than you could understand what young thus was saying and although huge and are sremurd may appear more times on the list bobby shmurda took the crown with his single hot night which has engaged more than 300 page views since july last year even with the young thus and shmurdas in the ran game fan found themselves furiously searching content from 201 and 201 just under half the songs you will find below were not from 201 most notably 201 is two ran biggest songs drunk in love and ran god sit at the top of our view count in an even bigger twist hendricks later flexed his influence with mad city the 8th track from his modern classic good kid mad city broke into the top 10 beyond ft jay drunk in love mine ran god bobby shmurda hot night rich gang lifestyle beyond partition drake 10 the catch up little wayne ft drake believe me the went ft ty doll sign and wiz halifax or ah remain hendricks later ft my eight mad city 10 big seen ft 40 do not fuck with you 11 ti young thus about the money 12 there like the worst 13 are sremurd no

charlie wilson bound most viewed artists in 2014song views may rule the root when it comes to who had the hottest meme of the minute but an artist is the total package in 201 only six of the most viewed artists on genius released full albums the most surprising addition to the top ten is childish gambling seeing his name there with rays heavyweights shows how far he is come from that infamous 16 drake took 201 is crown as the most viewed artist on genius is this surprise yes for two reasons the list does not include features and drake only released handful of tracks in 201 meaning he relied heavily on 201 is nothing was the same it looks like very was right all along drake really is the most popular man in ran drake mine beyond any west hendricks later childish gambling jay little wayne come 10 the went 11 nick mind 12 rich ross 13 schoolboy 14 there like 15 rich gang 16 chief key 17 chris brown 18 big seen 19 chance the rapier was soon as posiblerocky bonus the carters beyond and jay appear in the top ten artists but only on records fearing each other in the most viewed songs list this cement their power couple brand but raises more questions about their individual status have the beyond and jay bands been replaced by the carters what lyric did you search for this year surprised not to see something on the list let us know in the comments1130,,g am that night with the

it better find way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like have already said this pavilion eighty times how many times can say the same thing different ways that rhyme what really want to say is

tools to hopefully use it to make you strong and enough to lift yourself up when you feel like felt cause can not explain to pal how sang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my damn self but

muchanticipated album coming and zero second thoughts you have to honor that inner voice family camel is late for branch but not sullen rockstar hidingbehindshades late more like 19yearold mixeduptheadres late she is running through the dining room of versailles cuban restaurant deep in los angeles san fernando valley lush black hair streaming apologies pouring forth having just rushed from the other versailles in the city is center as soon as she sits on this midjanuary sunday morning flashing that disarmingly broad smile the singer who was born in cuba besides in mimi and is staying in an airbnb here in town says have got you on what we are going to eat she then proceeds to order in rapidfire spanish bounty of food lemonade speaks rice beans planting coquette plan confusion stress the promise of splendid feast that has pretty much been the story of camel is recent life it was only month before this weekend that she was still member of fifth harmony the most successful girl group since destiny is child with more than million digital songs sold according to neilsen music before the year was out she was solo artist gathering accusations from her bandages namely that she quit through her representatives after lodging series of label intervention and therapy sessions and even hatetwets from zealous fan see camilaisoverparty but that is the confusion and stress during that same time camel had plenty to celebrate the singer who had collaborated outside of oh for some time released the darkly sex rapromp single bad things with machine gun belly last october and it climbed the charts it is now no on the mainstream top 40 chart and that is not even her first hit know what you did last summer her 201 due with shown mended peaked at no 20 on the billboard hot 100 she has social numbers to rival the band is 34 million to oh is 38 million on twitter and 88 million to 82 million on instagram guest turn on major later song banker and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalist on what seems in introspect like an inevitable transition to solo stardom it would take big force to stop her from taking over the world says her friend mended adding she was such great writing partner barely had to speak and she knew exactly what meant but camel whose album is due this fall already had fame fortune and obsessive fan the true gift after five years of nonstop pouring recording and metandgrets with oh is the taste of freedom you know that quote in the silence you find god asks camel who in her lace choked holy white the and black marching band coat looks like the petite she is 5fot2 commander of some fun and fashionable army felt like could hear everything my heart was telling me the heart of course can be an reliable guide and by going solo camel is risking more than the sings and arrows of unhappy harmonized oh fan who easily overrun fan polls like the one for the mt video music awards 201 song of the summer contest in which work from home crushed massive songs by calvin harris and drake are not to be underestimated only one woman has recently left girl group for colossal solo career and she is not an ordinary human she is beyond the closer models for camel may be her fellow talentshow contestants in one direction but none of their trajectories will quite work for woman who has to as it seems all young female pop stars must thread the wholesomeandsexy needle hayn talk disavow his past grafted his home clustered himself in weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album all of which only made him cooper nail horn took backpacking trip rediscovered the 70 folkrock of his youth and launched career as troubadour which just made him dreamer harry style is already considered rock star without having sung solo note camel lest she be judged must be seductive but pure of heart strong but vulnerable selfposesed but not selfish in way girlgroup rules still apply but that has not stopped her from building on her momentum and not just by hitting the studio and bringing bad things to the even degenerates show with machine gun belly in january her first post to appearance month after fifth harmony is final televised performance she has also carefully cultivated her public voice telling lent durham in lent interview before donald tramp is inauguration am going to stick up for immigrants and am going to stick up for hispanic people and their rights after tramp issued his immigration order she treated the muslimban is dehumanizing beyond words in in shock this is not who we are the easiest route would be to shut my mouth sing the songs wear the clothes and keep going you know says camel with battery laugh weighing life in oh against going it alone mean we were at the peak of our career it is definitely not the safe option but she says have it in my da the way my mon raised me it has always been do not settle jump and hope you grow wings on the way down she flings her arms like she is on roller coster feel alive the lyric analysis site genius recently determined that camel sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in fifth harmony is songs even when she was doing the most inside the group camel was doing the most outside it too she started writing on her own early in oh is career despite the greeting schedule her friend taylor swift is red inspired her to make tonic photographs of her changing life so when she was not cutting parts for oh is 201 better together up at hollywood is record plant she would be in the studio is grm writing lyric over other artists memories about things like my first kiss and my first boyfriend then she got garageband and mid keyboard and began churning out thirty demon while pouring walls and in time areas would wake up super early says camel get off the bus go to the hotel put the to on super loud did not want people to hear me fig yelling then go into the bathroom put my lawton on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day so she was basically singing into the toilet yep she has done her 100 hours says camel is manager roger gold founder of 300 entertainment fifth harmony worked incredibly hard 1andahalf months of the year it was an incredible school but when it finally came time for camel to go solo bitter previously unhintedat feelings erupted in shocking public way when ask her about it camel does not shy away from discussing the drama of late december 201 although she clearly means to take the high road when did the relationship between you and the group start to change do not know was always super open that could not just sing other people is words and be totally happy with that you have to follow and honor that inner voice always encouraged the girls to do the same do you feel like that changed the relationship your asserting that think that in group there is always going to be tension whether it is because of this thing or another thing obviously think that rocked the boat have you been in touch with anyone in oh since all that went down no have you reached out directly did yeah do not want to get into the details of that because it was really intense and it is hard for me to talk about it makes me sad when first heard you were going solo was like am sure there are no hard feelings because this is not surprise then was like what is happening had the same reaction hoped that it would be peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other but only got love for them camel took her first vacation in five years on christmas after her mother since insisted she plug with the family including her dad alexandre and 9yearold sister sofa for three weeks in canon the first four days were trip says camel was stressing about not stressing about something sometimes you are afraid of the quiet like go go go camel was raised in havana and later mexico city when she was her folks told her they were going to dinner world instead family and sinus as she is called emigrated legally from mexico spent day in holding took hour bus ride to mimi and moved in with friend alexandre was forced to stay behind but after yearandahalf of headache he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over sinus was an architect in cuba but found work at marshalls stocking shoes alexandre when he arrived washed cars at the mall today they have successful contracting company my parents worked really hard says camel we always had periods where my dad would be out of job it was constant flow of having money losing everything and then finding way to get it again if we had food to eat roof over our heads and was going to school that was enough alexandre finally got his isa in 201 and camel sent her parents to jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had camel is florida friends who all private her appearance on the factor recollected for friendsgiving in 201 and faceted an eighthgrade theater teacher who encouraged camel when she first got into acting and singing she is not much for going out had phase in mimi where was like am going to do all the things would do if were 19 which she is went to clubs and was like do not love this after our branch in los angeles she plans to meet troy ivan for coffee and then have him and swift over to her silver lake airbnb for some chill stuff mainly camel is focused on making music even her hobbies serve the cause for song ideas she mines poetry the book milk and honey by young feminist rupia your made her cry novels currently love in the time of cholera by gabriel area marque moves her favorites include the notebook titanic rome juliet and above all the 201 room serendipity and inspiration quotes she finds on tumbler she also enjoys practicing guitar oh player and super close friend asile june gave her daily lessons on the group is 27 tour in 201 romantically speaking says camel do not have anything going on right now although she does let slip that literally every boy have liked has been scorpio rumormongers take note mended is leo and when we start talking about la la land she winds up telling an unbelievable story love the movie because am such hopeless romantic it made me feel like could meet anybody anywhere like yesterday asked my user driver for his number because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like just came out of relationship he just sounded like he was hopeless romantic and was like you know what will get his number he never tested me back what do not know maybe it did not go through few weeks after our branch in early february camel is in the booth at sphere studies in los angeles lawton out and notes a open singing from file called it is only natural using her chest too and slight paris it is only natural need some love from you might pull up on you it is only human to want to do da things we do the vocal is army and bright over steel drums and jack style edited vocal samples never underestimated her talent but was not expecting her to have such powerful vision says andrew pop wanted who is known for his work with kehlani and alesha care from the control room it is real collaboration chimes in producer frank dukes who has worked with drake and train scott sometimes it is like band just farming the trip has been hoping handful of songs that skillfully blend camel is love for diana is anti can loop it forever she says the era of randbpop that includes alicia keys 207 song no one all things shaking and of course cuban music they want to open the up with dusty pianoclanging cut called havana and review an beat caribbean theater that sounds like sir planting flag in one dance family is an incredible songwriter says epic records chairman co antonio la reid who with simon towel assembled oh for the factor and still has camel on his foster she is working overcome camel is mon pips into the studio to remind her she has call in 15 minutes sinus is not manager so much as her daughter is right hand and confidante along with the other members of oh she has been by camel is side the entire time and now she is the only one left who has seen it all fifth harmony meanwhile is smoldering on without camel epic plans to release an album from the group in 201 too and oh is people is choice awards performance of work from home in january was an unmistakable shoulderbrush as fifth harmony changed the to we in camel is opening line are not worried about nothing and punctured it with full stop know people will try and turn this into is she going to be more successful outside the group if am growing as an artist that is success in april 201 interview the members of fifth harmony for billboard cover story and the chat quickly turned into teardrenched firing of grievances about the group is toll on their private lives the only one who did not cry was camel was like oh my god this is the saddest thing have ever seen am sorry about that she tells me this time around camel was not immune to the pressure just on the mend fighting anxiety with journalist exercise meditation and music remind her what she told me then that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her it is so hard to hear that says camel lowering her head it breaks my heart it is like am watching myself from another person is perspective like damn poor girl she did finally cry after the turmoil with the group in mimi with her parents and sister and then she says went to the beach lot listened only to latin music it reminds me of where come from and that this conflict does not have to be world war ii in cuba people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity that is real shit not this know people will try and turn this into is she going to be more successful outside the group continues camel to me if am in the studio every day and am growing as an artist and am speaking from my heart that is success the results do not matter mean is not that the goal if camel is anxious now it does not show she seems proud of what oh was we represented all different kinds of women coming together she says fondly but is candid about what it was not we did not write our records we were interpreting somebody else is story fifth harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us and do not think anybody felt individually represented by the sound we did not make it1336,,and you
